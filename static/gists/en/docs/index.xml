Please open selector window from Tools/anatawa12's gist selector, check gists you want to enable, and click Apply Changes.
Some package cannot be enabled because some dependency is missing.
For example, SetRandomBlueprintId is made for VRCSDK Base so if your project doesn&amp;rsquo;t have VRCSDK Base, this is disabled.</description></item></channel></rss>
