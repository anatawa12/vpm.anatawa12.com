Please open selector window from Tools/anatawa12's gist selector, check gists you want to enable, and click Apply Changes.
With the Search field at the top, you can filter by name or description.
Some package cannot be enabled because some dependency is missing.
For example, SetRandomBlueprintId is made for VRCSDK Base so if your project doesn&amp;rsquo;t have VRCSDK Base, this is disabled.</description></item><item><title> Copy Cloth Settings By Distance</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/gists/en/docs/reference/-copy-cloth-settings-by-distance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/gists/en/docs/reference/-copy-cloth-settings-by-distance/</guid><description>Copy Cloth Settings By Distance # Copy cloth settings from source cloth to destination cloth based on distance from a point.
