Please open selector window from Tools/anatawa12's gist selector, check gists you want to enable, and click Apply Changes.
Some package cannot be enabled because some dependency is missing.
For example, SetRandomBlueprintId is made for VRCSDK Base so if your project doesn&amp;rsquo;t have VRCSDK Base, this is disabled.</description></item><item><title>Actual Performance Window</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/gists/en/docs/reference/actual-performance-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/gists/en/docs/reference/actual-performance-window/</guid><description>Actual Performance Window # Actual Performance Window is a window to see Performance Rank of your Avatar in Play Mode or just after building your avatar without launching your VRChat Client.
