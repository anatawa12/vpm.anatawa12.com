Overriden PrefabSafeSet properties are now highlighted as blue and bold #200 Fixed # Error when we removed some modification in PrefabSafeSet #201 There are several situations for this problem: When we removed value in original component When we removed new value in overrides When we reverted added twice in overrides When we reverted deletion in overrides When we reverted fake deletion in overrides Error when we reverted whole PrefabSafeSet with modifications #201 0.4.2 - 2023-05-30 # Fixed # MergeSkinnedMesh depends on other EditSkinnedMesh components does not working #195 Error with removed modified property in PrefabSafeSet Editor #196 Apply on Play may not work #198 0.4.1 - 2023-05-23 # Changed # Reimplemented Animation Mapping System Completely #168 This should fixes problem with objects/components at same place. Improve Animation Mapping System #172 This should reduce build time Disable animating m_Enabled of source SkinnedMeshRenderer #190 Animating m_Enabled of source SkinnedMeshRenderer now doesn\u0026rsquo;t affects merged SkinnedMeshRenderer If you actually want to enable/disable merged SkinnedMeshRenderer, animate m_Enabled of merged SkinnedMeshRenderer instead. Fixed # Error is not cleared on build #170 Merge PhysBone is not working #177 Previously, values are not copied correctly The help box for description of components without description were shown #178 Name of Is Animated and Parameter field are not correct #183 We cannot set override setting of Colliders to Copy #183 Error with MergeToonLit #185 Poor word choice in Japanese Translation #174 Localization is not applied for some fields #186 0.4.0 - 2023-05-20 # Added # Japanese Translation: 日本語化 #152 Changed # Save format for MergePhysBone #166 Previously used backed PhysBone component for override values are removed. There are no changes in behaviour. Just migrate your assets. Removed # Delete GameObject feature #153 Use EditorOnly tag instead Fixed # Error with Animator at non-root GameObject #164 Error with copied MergePhysBone component #165 0.3.5 - 2023-05-15 # Changed # Internal Errors not relates to any Object are now reported #160 Fixed # Error if there are multiple GameObjects with same path #159 0.3.4 - 2023-05-15 # Fixed # Reference to Component will become None #156 BlendShapes for Eyelids can be broken with FreezeBlendShape #154 0.3.3 - 2023-05-14 # 0.3.2 - 2023-05-14 # Added # Error Reporting System #124 This adds window shows errors on build This is based on Modular Avatar\u0026rsquo;s Error Reporting Window. thanks @bdunderscore Website for AvatarOptimizer #139 Available at https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/ Manual Bake Avatar #147 Left click the avatar and click [AvatarOptimizer] Manual Bake Avatar Changed # Improved \u0026amp; reimplemented Animation (re)generation system #137 This is completely internal changes. Should not break your project In previous implementation, animations for GameObjects moved by MergeBone, MergePhysBone or else doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well This reimplementation should fix this problem Fixed # Migration fails with scenes/prefabs in read-only packages #136 Now, migration process doesn\u0026rsquo;t see any scenes/prefabs in read-only packages. 0.3.1 - 2023-05-05 # Fixed # Can\u0026rsquo;t remove SkinnedMeshRenderer error #133 This error should do nothing bad but it confuses everyone Bad behaviour with VRCFury on build #134 0.3.0 - 2023-05-04 # Added # Make Children of Me #100 As a alternative of feature removal in same pull request UnusedBonesByReferencesTool #112 This is port of UnusedBonesByReferencesTool by Narazaka Support for VRCSDK 3.2.0! #117 This includes support for PhysBone Versions and PhysBone 1.1 Changed # Use IEditorOnly instead of mokeypatching VRCSDK #102 Move the toggle for Override and the setting of the value after Override closer together. #105 With this changes, the merged PhysBone is now hidden. The merged PhysBone will be shown in Play mode. Now we can Copy (instead of Override) Pull, Gravity, Immobile properties even if Integration Type is overriden. #105 During migration, if Integration Type (previously called Force) is configured to be Override, Pull, Gravity, Immobile will be configured to be Override. This is BREAKING changes. Now we can Copy / Override Immobile Type and Immobile (strength) separately. #105 Previously, if you override Immobile Type, you also required to override Immobile but no longer required. This is BREAKING changes in the semantics of immobile property. Upgrade CL4EE to 1.0.0 #121 Removed # BREAKING Removed Prefab Safe List #95 BREAKING Removed RootTransform feature from MergePhysBone #100 See this issue comment for more datails. Removed support for VRCSDK 3.1.x. #117 Dropping VRCSDK support is a BREAKING changes. However, we may drop old VRCSDK support in the minor releases of AvatarOptimizer in the feature. In the other hand, we promise we\u0026rsquo;ll never drop old VRCSDK support in the patch releases. Notice: in the 0.x.y release, y is a minor releases in this project. Fixed # ShouldIgnoreComponentPatch cases compilation error #108 Merge PhysBone is working even if parents are differ #129 0.2.8 - 2023-04-19 # Fixed # NullReferenceException with prefabs in editor for PrefabSafeSet #92 0.2.7 - 2023-04-01 # Added # Support for VRCSDK 3.1.12 and 3.1.13 0.2.6 - 2023-03-31 # Added # Internationalization support #77 This adds way to translate editor elements. However, no other language translation than English is not added yet. Please feel free to make PullRequest if you can maintain the translation. Fixed # Remove Empty Renderer Object is not shown on the inspector #76 normal vector and tangent vector might not be unit length #81 This can be problem with FreezeBlendShape. Assertion does not work well #85 This can make invalid mesh Mesh is broken if more than 65536 vertices are exists #87 Because we didn\u0026rsquo;t check for vertices count and index format, vertex index can be overflow before. Generated assets are invisible for a while #88 0.2.5 - 2023-03-24 # Added # Show SaveVersion internal property on editor. #71 This makes it easier to make it easier to see prefab overrides Changed # reduce unnecessary modification in PrefabSafeSet/List #64 Previously PrefabSafeSet/List will always generates array size change modification. Now, array size change will be generated when added/removed elements from the collection. use ExecuteAlways instead of ExecuteInEditMode #72 Fixed # save version is not saved again #69 None is added/removed on the prefab modifications #73 0.2.4 - 2023-03-22 # Changed # make Accessing v1 error #61 This reduces future mistakes like #59 Fixed # RemoveMeshInBox refers old v1 configuration #60 0.2.3 - 2023-03-20 # Fixed # instantiating material occurs #58 0.2.2 - 2023-03-20 # Added # Make Children #53 Changed # Do not use cache on applying components now #56 Fixed # NullReferenceException if some component is removed #54 save version is not saved. this may break future migration #55 0.2.1 - 2023-03-20 # Fixed # Migration failed if some renderer is None #49 0.2.0 - 2023-03-19 # Added # Support for Prerelease in publish system #19 Changelogs (including ones for traditional releases) #19 Auto Test #23 Prefab support #11 Changed # BREAKING Save format for many components #11 Even if you added more elements than before on prefab, added elements on prefab instance will be kept. In previous implementation (unity default array prefab overrides implementation), can be broken easily. BREAKING All materials are merged by default #11 Due to save format migration, every materials will be marked as merged. If you have some materials not to be merged, please re-reconfigure that. Fixed # Fixed IndexOutOfError if there are more bones than bindposes #30 SkinnedMeshRenderers without bones will break mesh #35 We may forget checking components on disable objects #46 0.1.4 # Added # Support for feature Migration be0147b Changed # Box editor of RemoveMeshInBox 15fc931 Installer unitypackage name b32167f Warn if MergeSkinnedMesh is with SkinnedMeshRenderer with Mesh 1016aa6 Fixed # MergeToonLit is always marked as dirty 82ba212 RemoveMeshInBox does not handle bone correctly b2fea4f 0.1.3 # Fixed # Merge ToonLit error d0f1ef2 NRE if some bone is null 88efc2a 0.1.2 # Fixed # FreezeBlendShape behaviour 0cebf27 0.1.1 # Added # (internal) MeshInfo2 system for speed up 36716dd RemoveMeshInBox component 96f3526 Changed # Make VPAI installer unitypackage install 0.1.x 6615991 Editor of FreezeBlendShape cdd2031 Fixed # Several bugs 0.1.0 - 2023-01-16 # Changed # Move components from Anatawa12/ to Optimizer/ 949d267 Fixed # Several bugs 0.0.2 - 2023-01-15 # Added # Build Badges onto README 57614ac How to build onto README 2ad57cc Merge ToonLit Material a460e3f Fixed # FreezeBlendShape remains 95c0d43 0.0.1 - 2023-01-13 # Added # Merge Skinned Mesh Merge PhysBone Freeze BlendShape Merge Bone Clear Endpoint Position "},{"id":1,"href":"/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/clear-endpoint-position/","title":"Clear Endpoint Position","section":"Reference","content":" Clear Endpoint Position # This component will replace EndpointPosition to 0 with adding _EndPhysBone GameObject.\nThis component doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any configuration for now but there\u0026rsquo;s one button on the view.

Please edit SkinnedMeshRenderer component attached to same GameObject as MergeSkinnedMesh to set AnchorOverride or else.\nThis component is good for merging your cloth meshes and body meshes but not good for face meshes because BlendShape can cause performance impact. BlendShape is a feature became heavier in proportion to the count of vertices and BlendShapes. Merging SkinnedMesh increases vertices and face mesh usually have many BlendShapes. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s not good to merge face meshes.\nIn addition, because of same reasons, you should freeze \u0026amp; remove unchanging BlendShapes for body / cloth meshes. You can freeze \u0026amp; remove BlendShape using Freeze BlendShape component. Add this component to both/either merge source SkinnedMeshRenderer and/or merged SkinnedMeshRenderer to freeze \u0026amp; remove BlendShapes.\nSettings # Skinned Renderers # The list of SkinnedMeshRenderers to be merged.\nDrop to None element at the bottom to add renderer and reset to None to remove from the list.\nStatic Renderers # The list of MeshRenderers (without mesh transform).\nThose meshes are transformed to polygons weighted to one bone, the GameObject that MeshRenderer belongs to.\nDrop to None element at the bottom to add renderer and reset to None to remove from the list.\nRemove Empty Renderer GameObject # If this checkbox is checked and the GameObject SkinnedMeshRenderer belongs to does not have any other components than SkinnedMeshRenderer, the GameObject will be removed from Hierarchy.\nMerge Materials # If MergeSkinnedMesh component found some Materials used in multiple renderers, the Materials will be listed here.\nCheck Merge to merge those MaterialSlots (SubMeshes) into one MaterialSlot.
