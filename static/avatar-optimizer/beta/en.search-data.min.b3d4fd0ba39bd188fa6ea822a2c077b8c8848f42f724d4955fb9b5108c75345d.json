This tool is initially designed for VRChat avatars, but it might be usable for other Avatars supported by NDMF.\nNon-destructive means (in Avatar Optimizer):\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to unpack your prefab to apply Avatar Optimizer. What you have to do is adding component. Avatar Optimizer doesn\u0026rsquo;t affects avatar saved in your project, only affects temporal copy of avatar for building. Please note that non-VRChat avatar support is generally community-based and may not be supported by the Avatar Optimizer dev team.\nWhat is the goal of Avatar Optimizer? # The main goal of this tool is to help you optimize your avatar in performance without affecting the appearance so much, in non-destructive way.\nThis tool is not designed to make changes of the avatar behavior.\nAll non-configured changes in the avatar behavior is treated as a bug, even if it might be useful in some use cases.\nIn some cases, we may put off the bug since it does not affect so much for most use cases.\nHowever, the buggy behavior may not be considered in other components.\nHow is the behavior of Avatar Optimizer stable for future versions? # Avatar Optimizer uses the Semantic Versioning for versioning and mostly applies the rules of Semantic Versioning to the behavior of the components.\nWe guarantee that the behavior of already added components will not be changed in the same major version.\nHowever, we may add new features for already implemented component and the behavior of newly added components may be changed.\nIn some bugs, fixing them may change the behavior of the component widely.\nTo fix such bugs, we usually add new flag to enable the new behavior.\nBy making the flag disabled by default for already added components, we keep the behavior of already added components and by making the flag enabled by default for newly added components, we fix the bug for newly added components.\nThere are few exceptions for component behavior stability.\nThe features only for debugging the components are not guaranteed to follow the rules above.\nFor example, Debug Options on AAO Trace and Optimize component might be changed in any version. The features marked as experimental are not guaranteed to follow the rules above. The behavior of AAO Trace and Optimize component might be changed by implementing new optimization.\nHowever, the default settings of AAO Trace and Optimize component will never change the behavior and appearance of your avatar, so changes must not affect the avatar. When you encountered any unnatural or strange behavior other than these exceptions, please see FAQ first.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","section":"Docs","content":" Frequently Asked Questions # Here is the list of frequently asked questions about Avatar Optimizer. If you have some other questions, please feel free to ask on the GitHub Discussions, NDMF Discord or Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon). I\u0026rsquo;m usually use Japanese, but you can ask me with English.\nThe behavior or appearance of the avatar is changed when using AAO Trace and Optimize component # If the behavior or appearance of the avatar is changed when using AAO Trace and Optimize component, it is always a bug unless you depend on bugs in other components of Avatar Optimizer.\nPlease report it on GitHub Issues, Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon), Twitter, etc.\nMesh is invisible even though it is in the field of view # This problem is often due to forgetting to specify the Root Bone of the Skinned Mesh Renderer.\nAAO Merge Skinned Mesh component does not automatically set the Root Bone, so you need to manually set the Root Bone of the Merged Mesh1.\nIf you are using Modular Avatar, you can add MA Mesh Settings component to the root of the avatar to set the Root Bone and Bounds for the whole avatar.\nThe brightness of the meshes merged with AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component is different from other meshes # This problem is often due to forgetting to specify the Anchor Override of the merged meshes.\nAAO Merge Skinned Mesh component does not automatically set the Anchor Override, so you need to manually set the Anchor Override of the Merged Mesh1.\nIf you are using Modular Avatar, you can add MA Mesh Settings component to the root of the avatar to set the Anchor Override for the whole avatar.\nMaterial property animations conflict when using AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component # This problem is a known bug and is currently expected to conflicts.\nWhen merging meshes with animated material propeeries, be careful not to conflict. If there is a conflict, a warning will be displayed, so please check the warning.\nIssue of this problem: #340\nMaterial slot animations conflict when using AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component # AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component will merge material slots using the same material of the merge target meshes by default. This will also merge animated material slots.\nIf you have some material slots which will be replaced differently with animation, you should un-check Merge of Merge Materials of AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component.\nBlendShape animations conflict when using AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component # This problem is a known bug and is currently expected to conflicts.\nWhen merging meshes with animated BlendShapes, be careful not to conflict. If there is a conflict, a warning will be displayed, so please check the warning.\nIssue of this problem: #568\nPhysBones / Contact Receivers that are used in the OSC-based gimmick are not working # The AAO Trace and Optimize component is carefully designed to not change the behavior of the avatar. However, for technical reasons, the AAO Trace and Optimize component cannot detect some PhysBone / Contact Receiver components are used in the OSC-based gimmick or not.\nSome modern avatars have their own gimmicks based on PhysBone / Contact Receiver components, so those components will be forgotten to remove in most cases. Therefore, AAO Trace and Optimize will assume that such components are not for OSC-based gimmick, and remove them if they are not used for other ways.\nThis assumption is not always the case, so if you are using PhysBone / Contact Receiver components for the OSC-based gimmick without Animator or Expressions, please create Asset Description and please configure Parameters Read By External Tools for your OSC-based gimmick.\nIf the gimmick is published or selling, I would like to bundle your Asset Description with AAO to improve compatibility with the gimmick. If you would like to, please contact us on GitHub, NDMF Discord, Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon), or Twitter.\nI cannot upload the avatar because of pre-build hard limit check # Avatar Optimizer and some other non-destructive avatar modification tools may make your avatar not exceed the hard limit of VRChat. However, the upload button on the VRCSDK Control Panel will be disabled if the hard limit is exceeded with on-scene Avatar. You may use the following methods to skip pre-build hard limit check. Please note that those methods will not skip the post-build hard limit check.\nManual bake avatar before uploading the avatar.\nYou can use NDM Framework/Manual bake avatar on the context menu of the Avatar GameObject to apply non-destructive tools before uploading the avatar. This will clone your avatar and apply non-destructive tools to the cloned avatar, so your original avatar will not be modified.\nUse Upload without pre-check by Sayamame-beans.\nUpload without pre-check is a tool that allows you to upload the avatar without pre-build hard limit check.\nUse VRCQuestTools by kurotu.\nVRCQuestTools is a tool to easily convert your avatar to Android / Quest compatible avatar.\nAs a part of the tool, VQT Avatar Builder allows you to upload the avatar without pre-build hard limit check for Android build.\nI want to support the development of Avatar Optimizer # If you want to support the development of Avatar Optimizer, feedback on GitHub Discussions, bug reports, feature requests, etc. on GitHub Issues, and pull requests are welcome.\nIssues with good first issue are relatively easy to implement. It is recommended for your first pull request. Also, issues with help wanted are ones that lack developers or information. Your participation in discussions and development would be appreciated.\nI also accept financial support on GitHub Sponsors and Booth.\nMerged Mesh is a Skinned Mesh Renderer which is attached along with AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/changelog/","title":"Changelog","section":"Docs","content":" Changelog # All notable changes to this project are documented in this page.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog.\n1.8.7-beta.2 - 2025-02-21 # Changed # Removed missing viseme / eyelids warning #1401 Improved Optimize Texture a little #1404 This should reduce texture memory usage a little and fixes a bug that may increase texture usage. 1.8.7-beta.1 - 2025-02-16 # Fixed # Animations targets GameObjects includes \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; in their name can be broken #1399 1.8.6 - 2025-02-14 # 1.8.6-beta.1 - 2025-02-11 # Fixed # Error when we manually configure Merge Skinned Mesh for face mesh along with Trace and Optimize #1396 Missing localization for copy enablement animation related errors #1397 1.8.5 - 2025-02-05 # 1.8.5-beta.1 - 2025-02-04 # Fixed # Component Validation Errors doesn\u0026rsquo;t have error source component information #1390 liltoon Angel Ring MatCap settings broken #1391 1.8.4 - 2025-01-19 # Fixed # Performance improvements #1380 Meshes merged by AutoMergeSkinnedMesh might be incorrectly removed #1381 VRM: Fix BlendShape mapping #1375 VRM: Fix Trace and Optimize incorrectly merging Skinned Meshes with different FirstPerson settings #1376 1.8.3 - 2024-12-24 # 1.8.3-beta.1 - 2024-12-24 # Fixed # Prefab overrides on the scene are reverted on first load of the scene at first launch #1372 Animating transform with C# named properties are broken by merge bone #1373 Animator window won\u0026rsquo;t create such animation but some script generates and it works surprisingly Errors with blendShapes with exactly same name in a mesh #1374 Such mesh can be generated with Autodesk Maya or 3ds Max Unity API denies generating such mesh with C# so AAO will rename such blendShapes to unique name to support.

AAO 1.8.0 introduced BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh, but new default mode \u0026ldquo;Rename to avoid conflicts\u0026rdquo; would increase number of BlendShape. This feature is added to relax this problem by automatically merging multiple BlendShapes of one Mesh. With this feature, you can use rename mode without performance loss. Fix mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone #665 In addition to existing Copy and Override, we added Fix mode. This mode will try to correct roll axis by rotating bone. This feature allows you to configure the mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone. This is useful if all configuration is same but roll axis is different. Automatically merging meshes which have BlendShapes #1308 In previous version of Avatar Optimizer, meshes which have BlendShapes are not automatically merged. This was because BlendShape manipulation load is proportional to the number of vertices in Unity 2019. However, in Unity 2020 and later, BlendShape manipulation load is mostly proportional to the number of moving vertices. This means that increasing the number of vertices in a mesh which has BlendShapes does not increase the load of BlendShape manipulation much. Therefore, we decided to automatically merge such meshes. Improved OSC Gimmick Support #1306 We added two information for OSC Gimmick in Asset Description. By defining parameters read / written by OSC Gimmick, your OSC Gimmick no longer breaks. Fixed # Fix non-VRChat project support #1310 \u0026lsquo;shader\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a float or range property \u0026lsquo;prop\u0026rsquo; error #1312 Integer and Int confusion #1313 NativeArray leak #1314 Error if all components are on inactive GameObject#1318 1.8.0-beta.11 - 2024-10-27 # Changed # Show version name on NDMF Console #1309 Fixed # NRE if specified expression parameters is None #1303 This error only happens if you don\u0026rsquo;t use Modular Avatar since Modular Avatar will assign parameters asset. \u0026ldquo;asset is not temporary asset\u0026rdquo; error if no Modular Avatar is used #1304 Merge Skinned Mesh with Basic Mesh is not working #1307 Validation system in Avatar Optimizer is not working #1307 1.8.0-beta.10 - 2024-10-26 # Added # Right-click menu option to create a new GameObject with a specified component #1290 BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh #1286 #1299 You now can successfully merge Meshes with BlendShape with Merge Skinned Mesh. Actually, previous version does not have proper consideration for BlendShape. This version introduces options to select BlendShape behavior in Merge Skinned Mesh. Changed # More Preference Improvement #1288 Removed # Merging BlendShape from Rename BlendShape component #1296 We will add a new component for merging BlendShapes in the future. Fixed # PrefabSafeUniqueCollection does not consider unity fake null #1294 BlendShape with same name is impclitly merged in Merge Skinned Mesh #1286 Now you can rename BlendShape to avoid conflicts. 1.8.0-beta.9 - 2024-10-20 # Fixed # Error with material property animation #1285 InvalidOperationException in PrefabSafeUniqueCollection #1287 1.8.0-beta.8 - 2024-10-19 # Fixed # Animation for target renderer of Merge Skinned Mesh might be overridden by animation for source renderer #1276 Merge islands incorrectly when one island covers the other #1278 NRE when no AAO component attached #1281 1.8.0-beta.7 - 2024-10-18 # Added # Invert option for Remove Mesh in Box #1257 You now can remove polygons outside of the box instead of inside the box. Along with this new feature, we renamed Remove Mesh in Box to Remove Mesh By Box to make it more clear. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the class name of the component since it\u0026rsquo;s already a part of the public API. Remove Mesh By UV Tile, a new way to remove polygons #1263 You now easily remove some polygons of models configured for UV Tile Discard. This component removes polygons like UV Tile Discard with Vertex Discard Mode. Texture Optimizer support for tiling UV #1268 API for AtlasTexture Compability #1269 Automatically remove unnecessary material properties based on shader #1041 This feature is added to Remove Unused Objects in Trace and Optimize. When you changed shader for an material, properties for previously used shaders might be remain This may increase your avatar size by unexpectedly including unused textures Support for Shaders that depends on vertex index #1275 Avatar Optimizer will not automatically merge meshes that are using vertex index since merging them may change vertex order, which changes vertex index Changed # Transform gizmo are now hidden while you\u0026rsquo;re editing box of Remove Mesh in Box #1259 This prevents mistakenly moving the Skinned Mesh Renderer while editing the box. Make MergePhysBone implement INetworkID #1260 This allow you to configure networkid for merged PhysBone component Changed locale code for simplified chinese from zh-cn to zh-hans #1264 This would improve compatibility with other NDMF tools. Many NDMF tools uses zh-hans so previously you may see both 中文 (中国) and 中文 (简体). I think zh-hans is more accurate expression so I changed so. Fixed # InvalidOperationException with removing all polygon on one material slot #1255 Remove Mesh in Box does not work for meshes without Bones #1256 NullReferenceException in GetBlendShape if Mesh is not specified for SkinnedMeshRenderer #1267 NDMF Preview for Mesh by Box will is partially broken #1270 1.8.0-beta.6 - 2024-10-12 # Fixed # InvalidOperationException with AutoMergeSkinnedMesh #1253 1.8.0-beta.5 - 2024-10-12 # Added # Rename BlendShape component to rename BlendShapes #1245 This can be used to avoid blendShape name conflicts in Merge Skinned Mesh Changed # Performance Improvements with Mesh Manipulation, especially with blendshape-heavy meshes #1234 #1243 #1240 Fixed # maxSquish cannot be configured for mergePB#1231 Error from Optimize Texture if there is Merge Skinned Mesh with material slot animation #1235 Unncecessary Prefab Overrides are Generated with Prefab Safe Set #1236 CS8632 warning for released version #1237 Avatar Descriptor can be removed by Avatar Optimizer in extreamely rare case #1242 Material property animation with weight 0 layer might be broken with AutoMergeSkinnedMesh #1248 1.8.0-beta.4 - 2024-10-05 # Changed # Animator Parser Debug Window now supports ObjectReference animation support #1222 Reimplemented Animator Parser node system #1227 Renamed debug options internally #1228 This will lose previously configured debug options. However, debug options are not considered as Public API as stated in documents so this is not backward incompatible changes in semver 2.0.0 section 8. Fixed # API about Prefab Safe Set are broken with prefab instance #1219 Optimize Texture may cause false positive optimization with blendtree #1225 Error with PrefabSafeSet #1221 1.7.13 - 2024-10-01 # 1.8.0-beta.3 - 2024-09-30 # Added # API to get in advance whether a polygon will be removed #1177 Changed # Improved Prefab Safe Set, which are used in MergePhysBone, MergeSkinnedMesh, FreezeBlendShape and more components #1212 This should improve compatibility with replacing base prefab, which is added in Unity 2022. Allow multiple component for Remove Mesh components with API #1216 #1218 This allows non-destructive tools to add Remove Mesh components even if Remove Mesh component are added before. Fixed # Typo in menu for creating Asset Description #1213 Optimize Texture broken with Crunch Compression #1215 1.7.13-beta.2 - 2024-09-29 # Fixed # Default value for RemoveMeshInBox is not correct in Play mode #1217 This fix will make Initialize method set default value for boxes. 1.8.0-beta.2 - 2024-09-25 # Changed # Reimplement Preview system with NDMF Preview System #1131 This will prevent issues relates to Animation Mode bug. This allows you to preview Remove Mesh components without selecting Mesh OR while in Animation Mode. Fixed # Texture Packing which resolves to the white texture would break the Unity Editor #1193 Performance issues with preview system #1195 Avatar Optimizer does not support Additive Reference Pose #1208 1.7.13-beta.1 - 2024-09-23 # Fixed # Null Reference Exception with newly created VRCAnimatorPlayAudio #1199 Particle System that uses local scale will be broken #1197 Avatars with Visame Skinned Mesh disabled will not able to upload #1202 1.8.0-beta.1 - 2024-09-20 # Added # AnyState to Entry/Exit optimization in Optimize Animator #1157 If AAO found animator layer only with AnyState, AAO tries to convert them to Entry / Exit pattern. Currently due to implementation there are some patterns that can be convert but but not converted. We may relax some restriction in the future. Because we have to check for each condition if we use AnyState but we can check for only one (in best case) with entry/exit, this generally reduces cost for checking an parameter in a state. Combined with Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree optimization, which is implemented in previous release, your AnyState layer may be optimized to 1D BlendTree. Optimize Texture in Trace nad Optimize #1181 #1184 Avatar Optimizer will pack texture and tries to reduce the VRAM usage. Currently liltoon is only supported. Copy Enablement Animation to Merge Skinned Mesh #1173 This feature copies activeness / enablement animation from merge target renderers to the merged renderer. This feature is not enabled by default. You have to enable it in the inspector. This feature supports copying activeness animation of activeSelf of the GameObjects or ancestors of the GameObjects. However, this feature does not work if multiple GameObjects (or both GameObject and Renderer itself) are animated. In addition, this feature will be animate the enabled of the merged renderer, so you must not animate the enabled of the merged renderer. If animations are unsupported, AAO will show an error message and abort the build. Support Read/Write disabled Meshes with Av3Emulator Enabled #1185 Previously, AAO cannot process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator. Since this release, AAO can process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator. In addition, AAO now supports non-Float32 vertex buffers. We still use Float32 internally so Int32 data might lose precision a little. However, AFAIK there is no real-world problem with this so we implemented this way. If you found such a case, please report it. This change make AAO incompatible with Unity without Graphics. If you\u0026rsquo;re building your avatar with batchmode with -nographics, please remove -nographics. Asset Description for Avatar Modify Support bundled in an avatar, Shinano #1189 Changed # Skip Enablement Mismatched Renderers is now disabled by default #1169 You still can enable it in the Inspector. This change does not affect the behavior of previously added components. Use UInt16 index buffer if possible even when total vertex count is more than 2^16 #1178 With baseVertex in index buffer, we can use UInt16 index buffer even if total vertex count is more than 2^16. Of course, if one submeh references wide range of vertices, we cannot use UInt16 index buffer so we still use UInt32 index buffer in such a case. Removed # Unity 2019 Support #1146 For 2019 users, please use 1.7.x. 1.7.12 - 2024-08-27 # 1.7.12-beta.3 - 2024-08-25 # Fixed # Broken validation for MergePhysBone merging PhysBones with specified target #1160 1.7.12-beta.2 - 2024-08-23 # Fixed # FinalIK Gimmicks with IKExecutionOrder is broken #1153 1.7.12-beta.1 - 2024-08-22 # Changed # Rewritten Check for Update system #1151 Fixed # VRCConstraints with Target might be removed unexpectedly #1150 1.7.11 - 2024-08-08 # Added # VRCSDK 3.7.0 support #1140 This includes VRCConstraints support 1.7.11-beta.1 - 2024-08-07 # Fixed # Some Humanoid Bones might be removed #1137 Repeated AddPathDependency is broken.

Removed # Write to Asset on Play menu item which is no-op #1085 Fixed # Particle Syatem with Mesh Renderer shape will be broken #1093 1.7.5-beta.1 - 2024-06-03 # Fixed # Merge BlendTree Layer will break some BlendTrees that have overriden by other layers #1084 1.7.4 - 2024-05-17 # Fixed # Invalid AABB error message from UnityEngine if there are no source for Merge Skinned Mesh #1068 1.7.4-beta.1 - 2024-05-11 # Fixed # Some rare material swap animation can cause exception #1067 1.7.3 - 2024-05-10 # 1.7.3-rc.1 - 2024-05-10 # Added # Declare VRCSDK 3.6.x compatibility #1060 Fixed # Mesh preview may cause empty mesh on enter play mode if reload scene is disabled #1064 MMD Compatibility can be broken with Merge BlendTree Layers #1065 1.7.2 - 2024-05-09 # 1.7.2-rc.2 - 2024-05-08 # Fixed # Animators depends on the WD=off behavior can be broken #1062 1.7.2-rc.1 - 2024-05-08 # Fixed # Entry/Exit to BlendTree broken with None motion in default state 1057 An error with MergePhysBone #1061 1.7.1 - 2024-05-07 # Added # Add Simplified Chinese translation #1055 1.7.1-rc.1 - 2024-05-06 # Added # Implement mask texture editor #1044 Changed # Improved behavior with Read/Write Off #1045 Because of Unity limitation, AAO cannot process meshes with R/W off on Start so it will be error. However, on Awake, we can read them so AAO should process them. Since this version, AAO will process meshes with R/W off on Awake. This reduces the number of errors on the apply on play. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Av3Emulator, you still see the error. In addition, in such case, we\u0026rsquo;ll show Auto Fix button on the error message. If you press the button, AAO will fix the error by changing the mesh to read/write enabled. Advanced Options section has benn renamed to Debug Options #1052 This express the purpose of the section more clearly. Added Advanced Optimizations and moved Remove Zero sized Polygons to it #1052 The Remove Zero sized Polygons can break some shaders or animations so it\u0026rsquo;s not enabled by default. To make it more clear, we moved it to Advanced Optimizations. Fixed # Material Slot animations for multi-material multi-pass rendering are broken #1042 Previously we only preserves animations for the number of submeshes instead of material slots. Relax Bounds condition for Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh #1043 Previously, AAO doesn\u0026rsquo;t merge Skinned Meshes if bounds are different accurately. Since this version, AAO will merge meshes if bounds are the same with precision to the last 6 digits of decimal point. Entry/Exit to BlendTree broken with None state 1048 Particle System with bone-rigged Skinned Mesh Renderer will be broken #1054 1.7.0 - 2024-04-30 # 1.7.0-rc.4 - 2024-04-26 # Changed # Disabled AutoFreezeBlendShape for Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component #1029 According to the report, making some polygons zero-size by AutoFreezeBlendShape will make initializing avatar extremely heavy. After a small discussion, we decided to not automatically optimize Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component. Fixed # Animating m_Enabled of Animator as a Behavior is broken #1028 Since Animator.property become animating float animation property named property, AAO must keep it as Behavior.m_Enabled instead of Animator.m_Enabled but we were not. 1.7.0-rc.3 - 2024-04-24 # 1.7.0-rc.2 - 2024-04-24 # Changed # It will be error if read/write mesh is off in play mode again #1018 I found that we may not possible to read mesh with r/w mesh off mode in play mode with the Av3Emulator. Fixed # Box Editor of Remove Mesh in Box can be broke with scale of Skinned Mesh Renderer #1019 Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh is broken with BlendTree #1020 Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh breaks mesh-shaped Particle System #1021 In addition, reference to Skinned Meshes might be broken and this is also fixed. 1.7.0-rc.1 - 2024-04-19 # 1.7.0-beta.7 - 2024-04-16 # Fixed # NRE with AutoMergeSkinnedMesh #1010 Error with some rare animation clip #1011 1.7.0-beta.6 - 2024-04-13 # Added # Animations animating missing GameObject is removed #994 Since this update, animations that targeting GameObjects with post-AAO paths is no longer working. Please create animations that targeting GameObjects with pre-AAO paths. Remove Mesh by Mask #998 With this component, you can remove polygons with mask texture. You can use use mask for MeshDeleterWithTexture or alpha mask to remove polygons. Remove Empty SubMesh in Trace and Optimize #1007 This removes empty SubMeshes including becomes empty by optimization. Fixed # dependency is not child of root error if humanoid bone is moved to out of animator game object #995 1.6.13 - 2024-04-13 # Fixed # Animator Controller on the VRCStation will be broken #1002 Remove Component can be fails with RequireComponent attribute #1003 1.6.12 - 2024-04-09 # Removed # Activeness Optimization for Constraint component #996 The constraint component is too complex to optimize correctly and reliably 1.7.0-beta.5 - 2024-04-07 # Added # Components API for Scripting Usage #976 Fixed # Fix skipped parameter values in Entry/Exit to BlendTree optimization #991 1.6.11 - 2024-04-07 # Fixed # Bounds become broken if Update When Offscreen is enabled #990 1.7.0-beta.4 - 2024-04-05 # Changed # Renamed MergeDirectBlendTree(Layers) to MergeBlendTreeLayer #984 1.6.10 - 2024-04-05 # Fixed # Missing Reference Exception with Trace and Optimize #986 1.7.0-beta.3 - 2024-04-04 # Added # Merge non Direct BlendTree in MergeDirectBlendTree #980 Support bool parameters in Entry/Exit to BlendTree optimization #982 Fixed # Skip Merge Direct BlendTree Option is flipped #978 1.7.0-beta.2 - 2024-04-01 # Changed # Relax preconditions of Entry/Exit to BlendTree optimization #970 Fixed # Some animation is Falsely detected as constant #968 Activeness of renderer GameObject is not correctly considered #972 Exclusions is not working for Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh #972 1.7.0-beta.1 - 2024-03-29 # Added # Animator Optimizer #854 Most features of Animator Optimizer is not available in Unity 2019. Animator Optimizer optimizes your Animator Controller without behaviour Changes Current Optimizer includes the following optimization Remove meaningless properties #854 Converts Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree #854 #867 #927 Merges multiple Direct BlendTree to single Direct BlendTree #870 Removes meaningless Animator Layers #870 Asset Description #847 Asset Description is the file to provide information of your assets for Avatar Optimizer. Please see documentation for more details. Warning for material animation in Merge Skinned Mesh #769 Merge Skinned Mesh does not support animating material properties differently. (In other words, it can be broken.) Since this version, AAO will warn for such a case. If you animated all materials from same animations, your animation will not be warned. API for declaring dependency relationship to the name of the component #943 You can use this API to not change the name of the GameObject. Configuring Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated) #957 Since VRCSDK 3.5.1, VRCSDK sets Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated) to true on assembly reload. This is not a good setting for AAO in EditMode since AAO does not support clamping BlendShapes. That\u0026rsquo;s why AAO now configures Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated) to false in edit mode and true in play mode. PlayMode is usually used for testing the avatar behavior so it\u0026rsquo;s better to have the same setting as VRChat client. If you want not to change this setting, please disable Tools/Avatar Optimizer/Configure Clamp BlendShape Weight. Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh #952 Trace and Optimize now automatically merges Skinned Meshes if possible. Trace and Optimize will merge your mesh if the material properties or enablement of the mesh is animated similarly and has no BlendShapes. Changed # MergePhysBone now corrects curve settings #775 MergePhysBone now warns if chain length are not same #775 MergePhysBone with only one source is now error #775 It was not working well and not a error by a bug. Animator Parser is completely rewritten #850 New Animator Parser allow us to track animating properties animated by components removed by AAO. PhysBone that swings no bones are now removed #864 I found such a PhysBone on Lime so I added this feature. Switched Localization system to NDMF from CL4EE #873 Since this release, Avatar Optimizer is no longer depends on CL4EE. Because VCC doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove unused packages, CL4EE may still be installed on your project. If you want to remove CL4EE, please remove it manually. Suppressed animated BlendShape warning of FreezeBlendShape if it\u0026rsquo;s animated to a few constants #881 Modern models have tons of BlendShapes to change their face shape but emotion animation of some of them animates such a BlendShapes to constant (default value). That\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary (incorrect I think) and force users to remove or change the clip when user wants to face shape. I see AAO users use FreezeBlendShapes for overriding such a BlendShapes on twitter. I think using this way is reasonable enough so I suppressed the warning if AAO detected such a usage. Minimum VRCSDK to 3.3.0 #882 VRCSDK 3.3.0 is required for stable NDMF-VRCSDK compatibility. Endpoint Position settings for newly created MergePhysBone is now Copy instead of Clear #945 The Clear settings will increase the number of PhysBone Transforms so it\u0026rsquo;s not better as a default settings. Improved activeness animation warning in Merge Skinned Mesh #948 Reduced false-positive warnings Previously, AAO warns if activeness warning is applied to different GameObjects. However, this can be false-positive if animation is applied to different GameObjects with same timing. Since this version, AAO will not warn if the activeness is animated in same animation clip with same curve. Combined warning per Merge Skinned Mesh component. Previously, AAO warns for each source Renderers. Since this version, AAO creates one warning for each Merge Skinned Mesh component. Add error for Cloth component in Merge Skinned Mesh component #949 The Cloth component is not supported by Merge Skinned Mesh component. In previous versions, AAO will keep the source Skinned Mesh Renderer if it\u0026rsquo;s with Cloth component by bug. Since this version, AAO will make an error if the source Skinned Mesh Renderer is with Cloth component. Remove Unused Objects now removes PhysBones and Contact Receivers with parameters defined but not used by Animator Controllers #959 Previously, AAO did not remove PhysBones and Contact Receivers if they are defined in Animator Controllers whether they are used or not. I thought such a PhysBones on the base body are rare but my friend told me there is Manuka has such a PhysBone so I added this feature. Dropping GameObject to PrefabSafeSet adds the All components on the GameObject to the PrefabSafeSet #960 You can add all PhysBones on the GameObject by dropping the GameObject to the MergePhysBone component. MergeSkinnedMesh now warns if Root Bone or Anchor Override are not set #963 Removed # Compatibility with VRCQuestTools v1.x #847 Please use VRCQuestTools v2.x, which has compatibility with AAO. Fixed # Inspector of ComponentTypePair (GCDebug) is broken #846 Bones swung by unused PhysBones (which will be removed by AAO) are not merged #850 Note that To fix this problem, AnimatorParser is almost completely rewritten. It\u0026rsquo;s not expected to have behavior change, but if you found some, please report it.

I\u0026rsquo;ve fixed some bugs in Unity 2022 in this release. Since this version, package.json declares Avatar Optimizer is compatible with VRCSDK 3.5.x. I was planned to release this changes while VRCSDK 3.5.0 is in beta. However, VRCSDK 3.5.0 beta was only 3 hours so I could not.

(Kind: Avatar Global Component)\nTrace and Optimize is quite carefully designed under the premise that \u0026ldquo;never let it affect the appearance.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, if any problems occur, such as appearance is affected or some gimmick stops working, they are all caused by bugs in AAO, without exception.\nTherefore, if you encounter any problems with this component, please report it.\nWe will fix it as much as we can. Currently the following optimizations are applied automatically.\nOptimize BlendShape\nPreviously known as Freeze BlendShapes but renamed to add more functionality.\nBy scanning animation etc., remove, freeze, or merge BlendShapes automatically to reduce the number of BlendShapes. Remove unused Objects\nBy scanning animation etc., automatically removes unused Objects (e.g. GameObjects, Components).\nIn addition, this will automatically toggle PhysBone Components if they are only used by toggled objects. Preserve EndBone\nPrevents removing end bones1 whose parent is not removed. Optimize PhysBone Settings\nOptimizes PhysBone settings for better performance. This performs the following optimizations. Merges PhysBone Colliders with the exactly same settings into one PhysBone Collider. Unchecks Is Animated if it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary. Optimize Animator\nOptimizes Animator Controller. See this section for more details. Merge Skinned Meshes\nMerges skinned meshes which don\u0026rsquo;t need to be separated.\nSome meshes may not be automatically merged in some cases, so use Merge Skinned Mesh manually if necessary. Allow Shuffling Material Slots\nBy shuffling material slots, you may reduce draw calls of the avatar. The order of material slots usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but it may affect the drawing order in rare cases. Optimize Texture\nOptimizes textures without affecting the appearance.\nCurrently, UV Packing and reducing texture size is performed only for materials with supported shaders. Also, You can adjust optimization with the following settings\nMMD World Compatibility\nOptimize with considering compatibility with MMD Worlds. e.g. Not freezing BlendShapes used by MMD Worlds. In addition, there are the following Advanced Optimizations.\nAutomatically Remove Zero Sized Polygons\nRemoves polygons whose area are zero. This can break some shaders or animated scales, so use it carefully. Also, there is Debug Options which is for workaround bugs but it\u0026rsquo;s unstable \u0026amp; not well-tested. See tooltips or implementation for more details.\nAnimator Optimizer # This feature currently applies the following optimizations.\nConvert AnyState to Entry-Exit\nThis tries to convert Animator Controller layers of AnyState type to of Entry-Exit type as possible. With other optimizations, AnyState type layers may be converted to BlendTree. Convert Entry-Exit to BlendTree\nThis tries to convert Animator Controller layers of Entry-Exit type to BlendTree as possible. Merge BlendTree Layers\nThis merges multiple BlendTree layers to single Direct BlendTree layer as possible. Remove Meaningless Layers\nThis removes layers which have no state nor a transition.

Therefore, Asset Description was added in v1.7.0 as a simple mechanism to specify components that should be ignored by Avatar Optimizer at build time.\nFor non-destructive tools, we still recommend you to continue to remove components in IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback or your NDMF Pass to prevent Avatar Optimizer from accidentally removing components when the execution order is incorrect.\nParameters Read By Extenral Tools # Components such as PhysBone and Contact Receiver will make parameters that can be read by OSC tools. Such parameters are readable by the OSC tools without being defined on Animator Controller or Expression Parameter.\nTherefore, Avatar Optimizer is unable to determine whether those parameters are simply unused or intended to be read by the OSC tools. Since undefined parameters are relatively rarely used by OSC Tools, components that make such parameters are removed if parameters are unused from anywhere on the avatar.\nTo prevent Avatar Optimizer from removing those parameters and components, you can specify the parameters that are read by OSC Tools in Asset Description.\nParameters Changed By External Tools # Currently this information is not actually used by Avatar Optimizer, but it is planned to be used in the future.\nAvatar Optimizer is planned to optimize Animator Controller by analyzing unchanged parameters. However, if the parameters are changed by external tools, this optimization will break effects of the external tools.\nTo prevent this, you can specify the parameters that are changed by external tools in Asset Description.\nCreate Asset Description # To create Asset Description, select Create/Avatar Optimizer/Asset Description from right-click menu in the Project window.\nAvatar Optimizer searches from all files, so the name and location of Asset Description are free.\nEditing Asset Description # Comment # The comment field is for writing notes.\nAvatar Optimizer ignores comments.\nMeaningless Components # Meaningless Components is the list of component types that you want Avatar Optimizer to ignore.\nPlease specify the Script Asset of the component.

Removing unused Behaviours such as PhysBones If there are enabled PhysBones which do not need to be swayed (e.g., the swaying target mesh2 is always disabled), extra computational cost is caused. Merging bones which is not animated or swayed with PhysBones If the clothes bones are nested into the body bones, there will be many bones which are never moved locally. Such bones cause extra cost. Merging meshes which are toggled together or never toggled If your avatar has only one cloth, it might not be necessary to have separated meshes for body, hair, and clothes. Even if you have multiple switchable clothes, it might not be necessary to have separated meshes with body, hair, and underwear. With AvatarOptimizer, these optimizations can be performed automatically by simply adding AAO Trace And Optimize component to the Avatar Root!\nUpload Avatar # Now that you have added AAO Trace and Optimize component, let\u0026rsquo;s try uploading your avatar!

Please refer faq for more details.\nChecking performance rank without uploading avatar # When using non-destructive avatar modification tools, Performance Rank on the VRCSDK Control Panel is no loner be relied upon.\nInstead, you can check Performance Rank in Play Mode with Actual Performance Window of anatawa12\u0026rsquo;s Gist Pack.

In other words, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to avoid use of com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.runtime in runtime assembly, you should use it only in editor assembly.\nSecond, If you want to configure components, you have to call void Initialize(int version) method to ensure the compatibility with future features.

The default configuration version should be described in the document of the Initialize method.\nWithout calling Initialize method, component will behave unexpectedly, or you may get error with future versions. Configuring component is only supported just after adding component, and configuring already existing component on the GameObject is unsupported. This is because some future functionality might be incompatible with the existing component configuration.\nFor example, enabling the inversion option of AAO Remove Mesh By Box component, added in v1.8.0, changes the meaning of box, which makes it incompatible with tools intended only for v1.7 and earlier.\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/developers/distributing-prefabs/","title":"Distributing Prefabs","section":"For Developers","content":" Distributing Prefabs # Avatar Optimizer mey help you making your assets lightweight and optimized.

If you use Asset Description for components that process something at build time or runtime, it may cause unexpectedly removing your components and your tool not working properly when the execution order is incorrect or unexpectedly changed.\nAvatar Optimizer internally uses this method to keep compatibility with well-known edit-mode tools.\nRemoving your components # There are several ways to process and remove your components from avatar before Avatar Optimizer processes on build. You can use DestroyImmediate method for removing your components.\nIf your tool is a non-destructive tool based on NDMF1, you can remove your components before the phases prior to the Optimizing phase of NDMF or before com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer plugin (with BeforePlugin) in the Optimizing phase. If your tool removes your components in Optimizing phase, it\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended to specify BeforePlugin even if your default callback order is before com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer plugin.\nIf your tool is a non-destructive tool not based on NDMF1, removing your components before the NDMF\u0026rsquo;s Optimizing phase is recommended. In this case, current NDMF executes Optimizing phase in order -1025, which is JUST before VRCSDK\u0026rsquo;s RemoveAvatarEditorOnly callback, so your tool should remove components with IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback with callbackOrder smaller than -1025.\nIf your components is only for holding data for your edit-mode tool and doesn\u0026rsquo;t affects on build or at runtime, you can remove your components in IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback as described above, or you can simply use Asset Description to register your components as safe-to-remove components.\nRegistering your components # If you want to keep your component after Avatar Optimizer processes, you can register your components to Avatar Optimizer to tell about your components.\nFirst, to call APIs of Avatar Optimizer, please make an assembly definition file2 if your tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t have.\nNext, add com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.api.editor to assembly references in asmdef file.\nIf your tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to depend on Avatar Optimizer, please use Version Defines. Because Avatar Optimizer didn\u0026rsquo;t have public API prior to 1.6.0 and will break in 2.0.0, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to add version range like [1.6,2.0) (or stricter like [1.7,2.0) when you need new APIs that can be available in the future).\nThen, define ComponentInformation for your component in your assembly.\n#if AVATAR_OPTIMIZER \u0026amp;\u0026amp; UNITY_EDITOR [ComponentInformation(typeof(YourComponent))] internal class YourComponentInformation : ComponentInformation\u0026lt;YourComponent\u0026gt; { protected override void CollectMutations(YourComponent component, ComponentMutationsCollector collector) { // call methods on the collector to tell about the component } protected override void CollectDependency(YourComponent component, ComponentDependencyCollector collector) { // call methods on the collector to tell about the component } } #endif In CollectMutations, you should register any mutation your component may do.\nIn CollectDependency, you should register build-time or run-time dependencies and related information of your component.\nPlease read xmldoc of each methods for more details.\nUse Asset Description # Please refer Asset Description for more details.\nNDMF, Non-Destructive Modular Framework, is a framework for running non-destructive build plugins when building avatars by bdunderscore. Avatar Optimizer uses that framework for compatibility with many non-destructive tools based on NDMF.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe file defines assembly other than Assembly-CSharp.
