The &amp;ldquo;avatar root&amp;rdquo; is the GameObject at the top of the avatar hierarchy. For example, in the case of a VRChat avatar, the &amp;ldquo;avatar root&amp;rdquo; is the GameObject that has the VRC Avatar Descriptor component. If you add any Avatar Global Components to anything other than the avatar root, you&amp;rsquo;ll see error on the inspector and will not have any effect.</description></item><item><title>Trace And Optimize</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/trace-and-optimize/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/trace-and-optimize/</guid><description>Trace And Optimize # Previously known as Automatic Configuration
This component will trace your avatar and optimize your avatar automatically. You can enable/disable some automatic optimization features with checkboxes.
This component is Avatar Global Component, so this should be added to an avatar root.
Currently the following optimizations are applied automatically.
FreezeBlendShape Automatically freezes unused BlendShapes in animation or else. Remove unused Objects By scanning animation, etc., Automatically removes unused Objects.</description></item><item><title>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</guid><description>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool # Marks it as EditorOnly that bones referenced only from EditorOnly meshes.

There are two sub-kinds.
Source Component # This kind of component will produce Mesh and some other properties of SkinnedMeshRenderer. Following components are Source Edit Skinned Mesh Component.
MergeSkinnedMesh
This component will produce mesh from other (Skinned)MeshRenderers.</description></item><item><title>Merge Skinned Mesh</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</guid><description>Merge Skinned Mesh # Merges one or more SkinnedMeshRenderer and MeshRenderers into one SkinnedMeshRenderer.
This component is Source Edit Skinned Mesh Component, so this should be added to a new GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component without Mesh specified.
This component will merge mesh, bones, Materials, BlendShapes, and Bounds but other settings will not be modified. Please edit SkinnedMeshRenderer component attached to same GameObject as MergeSkinnedMesh to set AnchorOverride or else.</description></item><item><title>Freeze BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/freeze-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/freeze-blendshape/</guid><description>Freeze BlendShape # Freeze &amp;amp; remove BlendShape from the mesh.

This component is Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component, so this should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component.
This component currently only supports VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit because I believe there are big demands but I may add support for other shaders. (also for third-party shaders) If you want other shader support, please write a issue</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh By BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</guid><description>Remove Mesh By BlendShape # Remove vertices transformed by specified BlendShape and their polygons.
This component is Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component, so this should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component.
Settings # You&amp;rsquo;ll see list of blend shapes and check to select blendShapes. If some vertices in your mesh is moved more than Tolerance by selected BlendShape, this component will remove the vertices.</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh in Box</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-in-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-in-box/</guid><description>Remove Mesh in Box # Remove some polygons in any of specified boxes.

This component should be added to a GameObject which has PhysBone Components.
This component doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any configuration for now but there&amp;rsquo;s one button on the view. Clicking Apply and Remove component will applies this operation and removes this component. This may be useful for developing avatars.</description></item><item><title>Merge Bone</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-bone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-bone/</guid><description>Merge Bone # If you add this component to some GameObject, this GameObject will be removed and bone is merged to parent bone.

This component is deprecated.
This function is not related to avatar optimization, so this component will be replaced by one in a currently planned non-destructive Avatar Modification Utils.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/404.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/404.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Basic Usage</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/tutorial/basic-usage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/tutorial/basic-usage/</guid><description>Basic Usage # Merge Meshes to reduce # of Skinned Renderers # You can easily merge Skinned Mesh with Avatar Optimizer!
Why will we merge Skinned Mesh?
Merging Skinned Mesh will reduce number of deforming mesh (skinning). Also, Merging with MergeSkinnedMesh can reduce material slots so we can reduce number of drawing.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;ll optimize Anon-chan as a simplest case.
First, create GameObject for merged mesh. Right-click avatar GameObject and click Create Empty to create new GameObject.</description></item></channel></rss>
