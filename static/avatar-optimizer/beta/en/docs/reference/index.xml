This component will trace your avatar and optimize your avatar automatically. You can enable/disable some automatic optimization features with checkboxes.
This component is Avatar Global Component thus this component should be added to avatar root.
Currently the following optimizations are applied automatically.
FreezeBlendShape Automatically freezes unused BlendShapes in animation or else. Remove unused Objects By scanning animation, etc., Automatically removes unused Objects.</description></item><item><title>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</guid><description>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool # Marks it as EditorOnly that bones referenced only from EditorOnly meshes.
This component is Avatar Global Component thus this component should be added to avatar root.
This is port of UnusedBonesByReferencesTool by Narazaka but run at build time.</description></item><item><title>Merge Skinned Mesh</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</guid><description>Merge Skinned Mesh # Merges one or more SkinnedMeshRenderer and MeshRenderers into one SkinnedMeshRenderer.
This component is Source Edit Skinned Mesh Component thus this component should be added onto new GameObject with SkinnedMeshRenderer without Mesh specified.
This component will merge mesh, bones, Materials, BlendShapes, and Bounds but other settings will not be modified. Please edit SkinnedMeshRenderer component attached to same GameObject as MergeSkinnedMesh to set AnchorOverride or else.
This component is good for merging your cloth meshes and body meshes but not good for face meshes because BlendShape can cause performance impact.</description></item><item><title>Freeze BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/freeze-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/freeze-blendshape/</guid><description>Freeze BlendShape # Freeze &amp;amp; remove BlendShape from the mesh.
This component is Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component thus this component should be added onto GameObject with SkinnedMeshRenderer.
Settings # You&amp;rsquo;ll see list of blend shapes and check to freeze blend shape.</description></item><item><title>Merge ToonLit Material</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-toonlit-material/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-toonlit-material/</guid><description>Merge ToonLit Material # Merge VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit materials to one material by packing texture manually.
This component is Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component thus this component should be added onto GameObject with SkinnedMeshRenderer.
This component currently only supports VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit because I believe there are big demands but I may add support for other shaders. (also for third-party shaders) If you want other shader support, please write a issue</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh By BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</guid><description>Remove Mesh By BlendShape # Remove vertices transformed by specified BlendShape and their polygons.
This component is Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component thus this component should be added onto GameObject with SkinnedMeshRenderer.
Settings # You&amp;rsquo;ll see list of blend shapes and check to select blendShapes. If some vertices in your mesh is moved more than Tolerance by selected BlendShape, this component will remove the vertices.</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh in Box</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-in-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-in-box/</guid><description>Remove Mesh in Box # Remove some polygons in any of specified boxes.
This component is Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component thus this component should be added onto GameObject with SkinnedMeshRenderer.
Settings # Adjust the value to add box. For each box, you can change the center Position, Size, and Rotation of the box. (In local coordinate)
Click Edit This Box to show Gizmo to edit the box like below.</description></item><item><title>Clear Endpoint Position</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/clear-endpoint-position/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/clear-endpoint-position/</guid><description>Clear Endpoint Position # This component will replace EndpointPosition to 0 with adding _EndPhysBone GameObject.
This component should be added to GameObjects with PhysBone.
This component doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any configuration for now but there&amp;rsquo;s one button on the view. Clicking Apply and Remove component will applies this operation and removes this component. This may be useful for developing avatars.</description></item><item><title>Merge Bone</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-bone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-bone/</guid><description>Merge Bone # If you add this component to some GameObject, this GameObject will be removed and bone is merged to parent bone.
If the parent GameObject also have Merge Bone component, two bones are merged to parent of parent bone and so on.

This component should be added to new GameObject.
Settings # Components # The list of PhysBone Component.
Drop to None element at the bottom to add PhysBone and reset to None to remove from the list.
Overrides # Below the configurations, there&amp;rsquo;s configurations like VRCPhysBone. For each property, you may select Copy to copy value from source property (only available if values from the sources are same) or Override to set new value instead.</description></item><item><title>Make Children</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/make-children/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/make-children/</guid><description>Make Children # These specified objects will be the children of this GameObject at build time.
This component is deprecated.
This functionality is not related to avatar optimization so this component will be replaced by component in a new non-destructive Avatar Modification Utils.</description></item></channel></rss>
