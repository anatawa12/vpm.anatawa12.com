This component will trace your avatar and optimize your avatar automatically. You can enable/disable some automatic optimization features with checkboxes.
This component should be added to an avatar root. (Kind: Avatar Global Component)
Trace and Optimize is quite carefully designed under the premise that &amp;ldquo;never let it affect the appearance.&amp;rdquo;
So, if any problems occur, such as appearance is affected or some gimmick stops working, they are all caused by bugs in AAO, without exception.</description></item><item><title>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</guid><description>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool # Marks it as EditorOnly that bones referenced only from EditorOnly meshes.
This component should be added to an avatar root. (Kind: Avatar Global Component)
This component is obsolete. You should use Remove unused Objects of Trace and Optimize instead. This component will never get algorithm improvements. This is port of UnusedBonesByReferencesTool by Narazaka but run at build time.</description></item><item><title>Merge Skinned Mesh</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</guid><description>Merge Skinned Mesh (MergeSMR) # Merges one or more SkinnedMeshRenderers and MeshRenderers into one SkinnedMeshRenderer.
This component should be added to a new GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component without Mesh specified. (Kind: Source Edit Skinned Mesh Component)

For BlendShapes with non-zero weight, freezing BlendShapes will reduce processing cost.</description></item><item><title>Merge ToonLit Material</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-toonlit-material/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/merge-toonlit-material/</guid><description>Merge ToonLit Material # Merge VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit materials to one material by packing texture manually.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component. (Kind: Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component)
This component currently only supports VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit because I believe there are big demands but I may add support for other shaders. (also for third-party shaders) If you want other shader support, please write a issue</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh By BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</guid><description>Remove Mesh By BlendShape # Remove vertices transformed by specified BlendShape and their polygons.
