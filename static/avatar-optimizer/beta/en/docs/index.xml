What is Avatar Optimizer? # Avatar Optimizer is a tool that helps you optimize your avatar. This tool is initially designed for VRChat avatars, but it might be usable for other Avatars supported by NDMF.
Non-VRChat avatar support is completely community-based and may not be supported by the Avatar Optimizer dev team.
