What is Avatar Optimizer? # Avatar Optimizer is a non-destructive tool that helps you optimize your avatar. This tool is initially designed for VRChat avatars, but it might be usable for other Avatars supported by NDMF.
Non-destructive means (in Avatar Optimizer):
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to unpack your prefab to apply Avatar Optimizer. What you have to do is adding component.</description></item><item><title>Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions # Here is the list of frequently asked questions about Avatar Optimizer.
