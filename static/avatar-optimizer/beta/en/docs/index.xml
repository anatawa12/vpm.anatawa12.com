What is Avatar Optimizer? # Avatar Optimizer is a non-destructive tool that helps you optimize your avatar. This tool is initially designed for VRChat avatars, but it might be usable for other Avatars supported by NDMF.
Non-destructive means (in Avatar Optimizer):
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to unpack your prefab to apply Avatar Optimizer.
