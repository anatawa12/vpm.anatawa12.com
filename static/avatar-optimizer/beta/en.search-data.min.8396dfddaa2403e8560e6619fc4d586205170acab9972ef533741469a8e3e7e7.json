This tool is initially designed for VRChat avatars, but it might be usable for other Avatars supported by NDMF.\nNon-destructive means (in Avatar Optimizer):\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to unpack your prefab to apply Avatar Optimizer. What you have to do is adding component. Avatar Optimizer doesn\u0026rsquo;t affects avatar saved in your project, only affects temporal copy of avatar for building. Please note that non-VRChat avatar support is generally community-based and may not be supported by the Avatar Optimizer dev team.\nWhat is the goal of Avatar Optimizer? # The main goal of this tool is to help you optimize your avatar in performance without affecting the appearance so much, in non-destructive way.\nThis tool is not designed to make changes of the avatar behavior.\nAll non-configured changes in the avatar behavior is treated as a bug, even if it might be useful in some use cases.\nIn some cases, we may put off the bug since it does not affect so much for most use cases.\nHowever, the buggy behavior may not be considered in other components.\nHow is the behavior of Avatar Optimizer stable for future versions? # Avatar Optimizer uses the Semantic Versioning for versioning and mostly applies the rules of Semantic Versioning to the behavior of the components.\nWe guarantee that the behavior of already added components will not be changed in the same major version.\nHowever, we may add new features for already implemented component and the behavior of newly added components may be changed.\nIn some bugs, fixing them may change the behavior of the component widely.\nTo fix such bugs, we usually add new flag to enable the new behavior.\nBy making the flag disabled by default for already added components, we keep the behavior of already added components and by making the flag enabled by default for newly added components, we fix the bug for newly added components.\nThere are few exceptions for component behavior stability.\nThe features only for debugging the components are not guaranteed to follow the rules above.\nFor example, Debug Options on AAO Trace and Optimize component might be changed in any version. The features marked as experimental are not guaranteed to follow the rules above. The behavior of AAO Trace and Optimize component might be changed by implementing new optimization.\nHowever, the default settings of AAO Trace and Optimize component will never change the behavior and appearance of your avatar, so changes must not affect the avatar. When you encountered any unnatural or strange behavior other than these exceptions, please see FAQ first.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","section":"Docs","content":" Frequently Asked Questions # Here is the list of frequently asked questions about Avatar Optimizer. If you have some other questions, please feel free to ask on the GitHub Discussions, NDMF Discord or Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon). I\u0026rsquo;m usually use Japanese, but you can ask me with English.\nThe behavior or appearance of the avatar is changed when using AAO Trace and Optimize component # If the behavior or appearance of the avatar is changed when using AAO Trace and Optimize component, it is always a bug unless you depend on bugs in other components of Avatar Optimizer.\nPlease report it on GitHub Issues, Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon), Twitter, etc.\nMesh is invisible even though it is in the field of view # This problem is often due to forgetting to specify the Root Bone of the Skinned Mesh Renderer.\nAAO Merge Skinned Mesh component does not automatically set the Root Bone, so you need to manually set the Root Bone of the Merged Mesh1.\nIf you are using Modular Avatar, you can add MA Mesh Settings component to the root of the avatar to set the Root Bone and Bounds for the whole avatar.\nThe brightness of the meshes merged with AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component is different from other meshes # This problem is often due to forgetting to specify the Anchor Override of the merged meshes.\nAAO Merge Skinned Mesh component does not automatically set the Anchor Override, so you need to manually set the Anchor Override of the Merged Mesh1.\nIf you are using Modular Avatar, you can add MA Mesh Settings component to the root of the avatar to set the Anchor Override for the whole avatar.\nMaterial property animations conflict when using AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component # This problem is a known bug and is currently expected to conflicts.\nWhen merging meshes with animated material propeeries, be careful not to conflict. If there is a conflict, a warning will be displayed, so please check the warning.\nIssue of this problem: #340\nMaterial slot animations conflict when using AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component # AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component will merge material slots using the same material of the merge target meshes by default. This will also merge animated material slots.\nIf you have some material slots which will be replaced differently with animation, you should un-check Merge of Merge Materials of AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component.\nBlendShape animations conflict when using AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component # This problem has been fixed since Avatar Optimizer 1.8.0. Please update to Avatar Optimizer 1.8.0 or later.\nPhysBones / Contact Receivers that are used in the OSC-based gimmick are not working # The AAO Trace and Optimize component is carefully designed to not change the behavior of the avatar. However, for technical reasons, the AAO Trace and Optimize component cannot detect some PhysBone / Contact Receiver components are used in the OSC-based gimmick or not.\nSome modern avatars have their own gimmicks based on PhysBone / Contact Receiver components, so those components will be forgotten to remove in most cases. Therefore, AAO Trace and Optimize will assume that such components are not for OSC-based gimmick, and remove them if they are not used for other ways.\nThis assumption is not always the case, so if you are using PhysBone / Contact Receiver components for the OSC-based gimmick without Animator or Expressions, please create Asset Description and please configure Parameters Read By External Tools for your OSC-based gimmick.\nIf the gimmick is published or selling, I would like to bundle your Asset Description with AAO to improve compatibility with the gimmick. If you would like to, please contact us on GitHub, NDMF Discord, Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon), or Twitter.\nI cannot upload the avatar because of pre-build hard limit check # This is because the upload button on the VRCSDK Control Panel is disabled if the hard limit is exceeded with on-scene Avatar.\nHowever, since VRChat SDK 3.8.1, VRCSDK allows you to start building and uploading the avatar even if the hard limit is exceeded with on-scene Avatar. Therefore, the recommended way to fix this problem is to update the VRCSDK to the latest version.\nWhen you have some problems with upgrading the VRCSDK, you may use some external tools that can initiate the upload process without using the VRCSDK Control Panel.\nI want to support the development of Avatar Optimizer # If you want to support the development of Avatar Optimizer, feedback on GitHub Discussions, bug reports, feature requests, etc. on GitHub Issues, and pull requests are welcome.\nIssues with good first issue are relatively easy to implement. It is recommended for your first pull request. Also, issues with help wanted are ones that lack developers or information. Your participation in discussions and development would be appreciated.\nI also accept financial support on GitHub Sponsors and Booth.\nMerged Mesh is a Skinned Mesh Renderer which is attached along with AAO Merge Skinned Mesh component.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/avatar-optimizer/beta/en/docs/changelog/","title":"Changelog","section":"Docs","content":" Changelog # All notable changes to this project are documented in this page.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog.\n1.9.0-rc.6 - 2026-01-21 # Fixed # NRE with exit transitions on complete graph-like layer #1601 1.9.0-rc.5 - 2026-01-21 # Added # Public API of MergePhysBone component MergePhysBone component is now part of public component API. Fixed # VRM: Improved robustness of parsing incompletely setup VRM0.x / VRM1.0 avatars #1599 1.9.0-rc.4 - 2026-01-01 # Changed # Reverted Ignore unknown IEditorOnly components and log a warning in console instead of showing a popup. #1592 We added button to ignore such components instead. As a part of this feature, we added Project-level settings to store a list of ignored components. You can access this settings in Project/Avatar Optimizer of Project settings and stored at ProjectSettings/AvatarOptimizerSettings.asset file. 1.9.0-rc.3 - 2025-12-25 # Fixed # Complete Graph to Entry Exit optimization broke such patterns with immediate transition #1588 This bug broke miminoko V2 Hard Mode. Thank you Safkert, the author of miminoko, for providing test data! 1.9.0-rc.2 - 2025-12-17 # Changed # Update some message text #1579 Improved preserving VRCSDK required BlendShapes #1585 Fixed # Error with Object as the animation target #1586 1.9.0-rc.1 - 2025-12-01 # Added # Experimental support for NDMF Platform Support #1577 #1576 This is an experimental feature that does not follow semantic versioning. Fixed # Error in AutoFreezeBlendShape with broken viseme settings #1575 1.9.0-beta.6 - 2025-11-24 # Added # Replace EndBone With Endpoint Position component which replaces the end bone in the vrc physbone with the Endpoint Position #1423 Automatic Replace EndBone With Endpoint Position #1423 Trace and Optimize now automatically replaces PhysBone\u0026rsquo;s EndBone with Endpoint Position if possible. Changed # Useful error message will be shown when known unity bug that prevents you from building your avatar #1563 Actually I cannot reproduce the bug so I hope this works but nothing certify this works. Fixed # Cubemap textures are removed unexpectedly #1566 Unexpectedly textures with uv transforms are atlased #1569 Error with insoncistent animator controller #1571 1.8.15 - 2025-11-24 # Added # Support for VRCSDK 3.10.x #1562 #1570 New internal component ParentChangeDetector is added 1.9.0-beta.5 - 2025-11-12 # Fixed # Compilation error with VRCSDK 3.7.x or older #1561 1.9.0-beta.4 - 2025-11-11 # Fixed # KeyNotFoundException in some cases #1560 1.9.0-beta.3 - 2025-11-09 # Added # Linear Entry-Exit support for Entry-Exit to 1D BlendTree Optimization #1498 #1506 Since this version, Entry =\u0026gt; State1 =\u0026gt; State2 =\u0026gt; Exit pattern is now supported. More cases are supported by Automatically Freeze BlendShape #1510 AAO can now freeze BlendShapes that are animated in animator layers with weights between 0 and 1. Remove unused textures in Remove Unused Objects 1502 Invert option of Remove Mesh by BlendShape #1535 Automatically merge PhysBone when no grabbing PhysBone is detected #1539 Automatic Merge BlendTree support for WriteDefaults off BlendTree #1283 Component API for Remove Mesh By Mask #1541 External tools can now programmatically add and configure RemoveMeshByMask components. Complete Graph to Entry Exit optimization #1544 New optimization in the Animator Optimizer, which is part of Trace and Optimize. It\u0026rsquo;s expected that this optimization will reduce the number of transitions computed every frame. After this optimization, Entry Exit to BlendTree optimization may be applied. Minimum linting for some mistakes that reduces the avatar performance #1549 AAO now performs basic linting to identify common mistakes that can negatively impact avatar performance. Currently, multi-pass rendering with exactly the same material is detected since it\u0026rsquo;s likely a mistake that clicks \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; button on the inspector by mistake. Max Texture Size component to limit texture #1516 Merge Material component which is successor of Merge ToonLit Material #1516 This component merges multiple materials into one material. This component supports many shader includes lilToon, ToonStandard and others. Merge ToonLit Material is now deprecated. Please use this new component instead. Merge ToonLit Material will be removed in next major version. This component will support both Skinned Mesh Renderer and Mesh Renderer. Changed # Avatar Optimizer will run as late as possible in NDMF Pipeline by default #1493 To achieve this, I changed the name of plugin class, which is internal API, to contain non-ASCII character (with escape sequence). It\u0026rsquo;s not recommended but when you actually want to run after Avatar Optimizer, you can use AfterPlugin api with \u0026quot;com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer\u0026quot; as the plugin name in NDMF. In such cases, it might be necessary to register your components to Avatar Optimizer with API. For more details about registering components, see Make your components compatible with Avatar Optimizer in the documentation. This changes order of default plugin order, but when your plugin depending on running Avatar Optimizer after your plugin, it\u0026rsquo;s better to use BeforePlugin api with \u0026quot;com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer\u0026quot; as the plugin name in NDMF. Moved removing submeshes with no materials assigned to the early process of AAO #1495 This should let other process like freezing blendshapes ignore such submeshes. Replace Mask Texture Editor \u0026rsquo;#1470\u0026rsquo; Ignore unknown IEditorOnly components and log a warning in console instead of showing a popup. \u0026rsquo;#1422\u0026rsquo; Orphan Vertices will be kept #1515 Vertices that are not part of any triangle will be kept. Orphan vertices are likely to be used to control the bounds of the mesh so they will be kept. Allow Shuffle Material Slots is now enabled by default #1533 Descriptive localized messages are shown in Play Mode when animation keys are removed #1461 When AAO removes animation keys because target objects are absent, descriptive messages in the user\u0026rsquo;s language are now shown in Play Mode to help understand what happened. These messages explain that the target object is absent, keys were removed by AAO, and suggest reporting if this is incorrect. In Edit Mode (upload builds), the behavior remains unchanged with a terse internal identifier to minimize avatar size. VRChat parameter drivers now work correctly when parameters are converted from bool/int to float during Entry-Exit to BlendTree optimization #1547 Based on fix from NDMF (bdunderscore/ndmf#693) Parameter drivers now use intermediate parameters to preserve original type semantics Motion time state is now supported in EntryExit to BlendTree optimization #1552 Motion time state is safe to convert to BlendTree since it does not affect parameter evaluation. This change may increase the number of states converted to BlendTree. Greater / Less and Float conditions support for Entry-Exit to BlendTree optimization #1554 Equals / NotEquals conditions for Ints or Bool operators are only supported in previous versions of Animator Optimizer. Please note that creating animator controllers that can optimized with this optimization is difficult with Float operators because we need to use BitIncrement/Decrement-ed condition threshold for exiting parameters. For example, when we use \u0026gt; 0 condition for entry transition, we need to use \u0026lt; 1e-45 (BitIncrement(0)), which is equivalent to \u0026lt;= 0, for exit transition. Streaming mipmap settings are copied when processing textures #1558 Fixed # Merging SubMeshes may not work for some meshes #1501 EnsureRunningOnMainThread can only be called from the main thread error in some cases #1503 Error from optimize texture when remove unused objects is disabled #1504 Unity error when SkinnedMesh has no blend shapes after optimization #1402 Mesh can be disappeared when BlendShapes with infinity in their delta are frozen with AAO #1518 Freezing them would result Infinity in vertex position, which results NaN or Infinity in bounds, which makes Unity to clear the mesh. VRM: A NullReferenceException or MissingReferenceException may occur when parsing incomplete VRM components #1524 MeshCompression settings is not preserved after AvatarOptimizer process #1529 This bug increases size of some avatars unexpectedly. This is fixed now. Missing Ignore Other Phys Bone support for Merge Phys Bone #1532 Ignore Other Phys Bone property is not supported by Merge Phys Bone. This was a bug. This version fixes this bug. Fixed Optimize Texture may throw error in rare cases #1538 Basic mesh support for remove mesh components #1530 You now can remove some portion of basic meshes with Remove Mesh components! This does not includes remove mesh by blendshape because basic mesh does not support blendshape. 1.8.14 - 2025-10-04 # Fixed # Optimize Texture will break EmissionMap of ToonStandarad #1525 1.8.14-beta.2 - 2025-09-13 # Added # Compatibility declaration for VRCSDK 3.9.x #1520 No breaking changes affect AAO, so no code changes were required. 1.8.14-beta.1 - 2025-08-09 # Fixed # AAO may break infinimation #1492 The infinimation is the technique of animation that may be used in NDMF or other tools. I hope most of AAO users don\u0026rsquo;t experience this issue for now, but will be spread in the near future. 1.9.0-beta.2 - 2025-07-28 # Fixed # Padding used in OptimizeTexture is too small that can cause problems with masks #1478 1.8.13 - 2025-07-28 # 1.8.13-beta.3 - 2025-07-28 # Fixed # Optimizing textures with some relatively rare texture formats #1485 Automatic MergeBone may break rendering if there is bones with scale zero #1486 1.8.13-beta.2 - 2025-07-26 # Fixed # VRCConstraints solve in local space can be broken with automatic merge bone #1484 1.8.13-beta.1 - 2025-07-25 # Fixed # Padding used in OptimizeTexture is too small that can cause problems with masks #1478 StackOverflow with infinite recursion when AdditiveReferencePoseClip has recursion #1480 Generating preview of MergeToonLit does not work #1481 Automatic toggle may create toggle for different object when multiple components on single GameObject #1482 1.9.0-beta.1 - 2025-07-13 # Added # Declare compatibility with non-VRCSDK platforms #1433 1.8.12 - 2025-07-13 # 1.8.12-beta.1 - 2025-07-04 # Fixed # Automatically disabling PhysBones may not work in some situations #1469 1.8.11 - 2025-05-23 # 1.8.11-beta.2 - 2025-05-18 # Added # Added support for Toon Standard shader added in VRCSDK 3.8.1 for Texture Optimization #1457 Added support for Toon Standard (Outline) shader added in VRCSDK 3.8.1 for Texture Optimization #1457 Fixed # Parameter is not applied in MergePhysBone #1448 The rotation / position of global physbone collider may be altered #1453 1.8.11-beta.1 - 2025-05-10 # Added # Added support for VRCPerPlatformOverrides added in VRCSDK 3.8.1 #1445 Added support for NDMFAvatarRoot added in NDMF 1.8.0 #1445 Added support for VRCFuryTest in VRCFury #1445 1.8.10 - 2025-05-04 # 1.8.10-beta.2 - 2025-05-04 # Changed # Replace GetComponent with TryGetComponent #1437 Fixed # Add missing [BurstCompile] to jobs #1418 Add Burst to dependencies directly #1419 Fixed Particle Systems are not correctly removed #1440 Fixed incorrect IsAnimated optimization of PhysBone if parent scale is changed #1442 Due to bug in PhysBone, IsAnimated Optimization would change behavior if parent scale is changed. This Canny is about this issue. 1.8.10-beta.1 - 2025-04-28 # Fixed # Synced Layers are not correctly proceed #1439 1.8.9 - 2025-04-11 # Added # Support for liltoon 1.9.0 #1436 1.8.8 - 2025-04-04 # Changed # Declare compatibility with VRCSDK 3.8.x #1432 No beta sdk for 3.8.0 (it was 3.7.x) so this is not possible before stable release. 1.8.8-beta.2 - 2025-04-02 # 1.8.8-beta.1 - 2025-03-24 # Fixed # Particle Systems referencing Skinned Mesh Renderers without material slots will be broken #1426 AAO\u0026rsquo;s removing unused submeshes feature will remove all submeshes if there are no material slots. However, Unity\u0026rsquo;s Particle System does\u0026rsquo;t require materials slots are present so AAO broke this relatively rare case. Optimize Texture is not applied in some cases #1427 1.8.7 - 2025-03-01 # Added # Context menu to add Trace And Optimize #1411 Undocumented trace level debug log #1414 Fixed # Animation Clips can be broken if timeline window is open #1417 1.8.7-beta.2 - 2025-02-21 # Changed # Removed missing viseme / eyelids warning #1401 Improved Optimize Texture a little #1404 This should reduce texture memory usage a little and fixes a bug that may increase texture usage. 1.8.7-beta.1 - 2025-02-16 # Fixed # Animations targets GameObjects includes \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; in their name can be broken #1399 1.8.6 - 2025-02-14 # 1.8.6-beta.1 - 2025-02-11 # Fixed # Error when we manually configure Merge Skinned Mesh for face mesh along with Trace and Optimize #1396 Missing localization for copy enablement animation related errors #1397 1.8.5 - 2025-02-05 # 1.8.5-beta.1 - 2025-02-04 # Fixed # Component Validation Errors doesn\u0026rsquo;t have error source component information #1390 liltoon Angel Ring MatCap settings broken #1391 1.8.4 - 2025-01-19 # Fixed # Performance improvements #1380 Meshes merged by AutoMergeSkinnedMesh might be incorrectly removed #1381 VRM: Fix BlendShape mapping #1375 VRM: Fix Trace and Optimize incorrectly merging Skinned Meshes with different FirstPerson settings #1376 1.8.3 - 2024-12-24 # 1.8.3-beta.1 - 2024-12-24 # Fixed # Prefab overrides on the scene are reverted on first load of the scene at first launch #1372 Animating transform with C# named properties are broken by merge bone #1373 Animator window won\u0026rsquo;t create such animation but some script generates and it works surprisingly Errors with blendShapes with exactly same name in a mesh #1374 Such mesh can be generated with Autodesk Maya or 3ds Max Unity API denies generating such mesh with C# so AAO will rename such blendShapes to unique name to support. Unity Animator does animate first blendshale only so second shape would generally removed by remove unused blendShapes. 1.8.2 - 2024-12-11 # Added # - button for prefab safe set #1368 Fixed # Errors with models with UV at very edge #1363 Errors if exactly same AnimatorController is specified for multiple playable layers #1366 Errors if objects removed by some component is listed on exclusions of Trace and Optimize #1367 OverflowException when creating prefab #1369 1.8.1 - 2024-12-01 # 1.8.1-beta.1 - 2024-11-30 # Fixed # Optimize Texture may break liltoon outline mask #1357 1.8.0 - 2024-11-30 # 1.8.0-rc.11 - 2024-11-29 # 1.8.0-rc.10 - 2024-11-28 # Added # Regex mode for OSC Parameters in Asset Description #1351 Removed # Prefix, Suffix, and Contains mode for OSC Parameters in Asset Description #1351 Please use regex mode instead 1.8.0-rc.9 - 2024-11-28 # Fixed # NRE if some playabke layer is missing from AvatarDesciptor #1350 1.8.0-rc.8 - 2024-11-17 # Fixed # NRE when saving Prefab with PrefabSafeUniqueCollection #1348 1.8.0-rc.7 - 2024-11-15 # Added # Optimize Texture support for Unity Standard, VRChat SDK Standard Lite, VRChat SDK Toon Lit Shaders #1346 If you want more shader support, please comment to #1183 with shader name and link! Changed # Make error for MergeBone with MergePB rotation mode fix #1345 This was not working as expected in previous version so I made this error. We may add support or change behavior in the future release Fixed # Error with nested merge skinned mesh #1340 Broken synced Layer support #1341 Unpacking prefab might look like some data lost in PrefabSafeUniqueCollection #1342 InvalidCastException with RenderTexture #1334 1.8.0-rc.6 - 2024-11-08 # Changed # Added animation validation warning for MergePhysBone limit rotation mode Fix #1336 Fixed # Broken Optimize Texture #1338 1.8.0-rc.5 - 2024-11-07 # Added # Automatically Merge Material Slot #1334 If you have multile material slots with same material, it will be merged automatically. Changed # Improved performance in RemoveUnusedMaterialProperties #1326 1.8.0-rc.4 - 2024-11-06 # Fixed # Animation bindings for BoxCollider generated by VRCStation will be removed #1331 This might break the GogoLoco or other flying avatar that supports Quest / Android. 1.8.0-rc.3 - 2024-11-04 # Changed # Improved performance in InternalAutoFreezeMeaninglessBlendShapeProcessor #1325 Performance improvements for AutoMergeBlendShape #1327 Fixed # basic Mesh Renderers are not considered in Optimize Texture #1328 1.8.0-rc.2 - 2024-11-03 # Fixed # Animation broken with auto merge blendShape #1324 1.8.0-rc.1 - 2024-11-03 # Added # Automatically Merge Blendshape #1300 This is new automatic optimization in Trace and Optimize This is a part of \u0026ldquo;Optimize BlendShape\u0026rdquo; optimization. AAO 1.8.0 introduced BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh, but new default mode \u0026ldquo;Rename to avoid conflicts\u0026rdquo; would increase number of BlendShape. This feature is added to relax this problem by automatically merging multiple BlendShapes of one Mesh. With this feature, you can use rename mode without performance loss. Fix mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone #665 In addition to existing Copy and Override, we added Fix mode. This mode will try to correct roll axis by rotating bone. This feature allows you to configure the mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone. This is useful if all configuration is same but roll axis is different. Automatically merging meshes which have BlendShapes #1308 In previous version of Avatar Optimizer, meshes which have BlendShapes are not automatically merged. This was because BlendShape manipulation load is proportional to the number of vertices in Unity 2019. However, in Unity 2020 and later, BlendShape manipulation load is mostly proportional to the number of moving vertices. This means that increasing the number of vertices in a mesh which has BlendShapes does not increase the load of BlendShape manipulation much. Therefore, we decided to automatically merge such meshes. Improved OSC Gimmick Support #1306 We added two information for OSC Gimmick in Asset Description. By defining parameters read / written by OSC Gimmick, your OSC Gimmick no longer breaks. Fixed # Fix non-VRChat project support #1310 \u0026lsquo;shader\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a float or range property \u0026lsquo;prop\u0026rsquo; error #1312 Integer and Int confusion #1313 NativeArray leak #1314 Error if all components are on inactive GameObject#1318 1.8.0-beta.11 - 2024-10-27 # Changed # Show version name on NDMF Console #1309 Fixed # NRE if specified expression parameters is None #1303 This error only happens if you don\u0026rsquo;t use Modular Avatar since Modular Avatar will assign parameters asset. \u0026ldquo;asset is not temporary asset\u0026rdquo; error if no Modular Avatar is used #1304 Merge Skinned Mesh with Basic Mesh is not working #1307 Validation system in Avatar Optimizer is not working #1307 1.8.0-beta.10 - 2024-10-26 # Added # Right-click menu option to create a new GameObject with a specified component #1290 BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh #1286 #1299 You now can successfully merge Meshes with BlendShape with Merge Skinned Mesh. Actually, previous version does not have proper consideration for BlendShape. This version introduces options to select BlendShape behavior in Merge Skinned Mesh. Changed # More Preference Improvement #1288 Removed # Merging BlendShape from Rename BlendShape component #1296 We will add a new component for merging BlendShapes in the future. Fixed # PrefabSafeUniqueCollection does not consider unity fake null #1294 BlendShape with same name is impclitly merged in Merge Skinned Mesh #1286 Now you can rename BlendShape to avoid conflicts. 1.8.0-beta.9 - 2024-10-20 # Fixed # Error with material property animation #1285 InvalidOperationException in PrefabSafeUniqueCollection #1287 1.8.0-beta.8 - 2024-10-19 # Fixed # Animation for target renderer of Merge Skinned Mesh might be overridden by animation for source renderer #1276 Merge islands incorrectly when one island covers the other #1278 NRE when no AAO component attached #1281 1.8.0-beta.7 - 2024-10-18 # Added # Invert option for Remove Mesh in Box #1257 You now can remove polygons outside of the box instead of inside the box. Along with this new feature, we renamed Remove Mesh in Box to Remove Mesh By Box to make it more clear. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the class name of the component since it\u0026rsquo;s already a part of the public API. Remove Mesh By UV Tile, a new way to remove polygons #1263 You now easily remove some polygons of models configured for UV Tile Discard. This component removes polygons like UV Tile Discard with Vertex Discard Mode. Texture Optimizer support for tiling UV #1268 API for AtlasTexture Compability #1269 Automatically remove unnecessary material properties based on shader #1041 This feature is added to Remove Unused Objects in Trace and Optimize. When you changed shader for an material, properties for previously used shaders might be remain This may increase your avatar size by unexpectedly including unused textures Support for Shaders that depends on vertex index #1275 Avatar Optimizer will not automatically merge meshes that are using vertex index since merging them may change vertex order, which changes vertex index Changed # Transform gizmo are now hidden while you\u0026rsquo;re editing box of Remove Mesh in Box #1259 This prevents mistakenly moving the Skinned Mesh Renderer while editing the box. Make MergePhysBone implement INetworkID #1260 This allow you to configure networkid for merged PhysBone component Changed locale code for simplified chinese from zh-cn to zh-hans #1264 This would improve compatibility with other NDMF tools. Many NDMF tools uses zh-hans so previously you may see both 中文 (中国) and 中文 (简体). I think zh-hans is more accurate expression so I changed so. Fixed # InvalidOperationException with removing all polygon on one material slot #1255 Remove Mesh in Box does not work for meshes without Bones #1256 NullReferenceException in GetBlendShape if Mesh is not specified for SkinnedMeshRenderer #1267 NDMF Preview for Mesh by Box will is partially broken #1270 1.8.0-beta.6 - 2024-10-12 # Fixed # InvalidOperationException with AutoMergeSkinnedMesh #1253 1.8.0-beta.5 - 2024-10-12 # Added # Rename BlendShape component to rename BlendShapes #1245 This can be used to avoid blendShape name conflicts in Merge Skinned Mesh Changed # Performance Improvements with Mesh Manipulation, especially with blendshape-heavy meshes #1234 #1243 #1240 Fixed # maxSquish cannot be configured for mergePB#1231 Error from Optimize Texture if there is Merge Skinned Mesh with material slot animation #1235 Unncecessary Prefab Overrides are Generated with Prefab Safe Set #1236 CS8632 warning for released version #1237 Avatar Descriptor can be removed by Avatar Optimizer in extreamely rare case #1242 Material property animation with weight 0 layer might be broken with AutoMergeSkinnedMesh #1248 1.8.0-beta.4 - 2024-10-05 # Changed # Animator Parser Debug Window now supports ObjectReference animation support #1222 Reimplemented Animator Parser node system #1227 Renamed debug options internally #1228 This will lose previously configured debug options. However, debug options are not considered as Public API as stated in documents so this is not backward incompatible changes in semver 2.0.0 section 8. Fixed # API about Prefab Safe Set are broken with prefab instance #1219 Optimize Texture may cause false positive optimization with blendtree #1225 Error with PrefabSafeSet #1221 1.7.13 - 2024-10-01 # 1.8.0-beta.3 - 2024-09-30 # Added # API to get in advance whether a polygon will be removed #1177 Changed # Improved Prefab Safe Set, which are used in MergePhysBone, MergeSkinnedMesh, FreezeBlendShape and more components #1212 This should improve compatibility with replacing base prefab, which is added in Unity 2022. Allow multiple component for Remove Mesh components with API #1216 #1218 This allows non-destructive tools to add Remove Mesh components even if Remove Mesh component are added before. Fixed # Typo in menu for creating Asset Description #1213 Optimize Texture broken with Crunch Compression #1215 1.7.13-beta.2 - 2024-09-29 # Fixed # Default value for RemoveMeshInBox is not correct in Play mode #1217 This fix will make Initialize method set default value for boxes. 1.8.0-beta.2 - 2024-09-25 # Changed # Reimplement Preview system with NDMF Preview System #1131 This will prevent issues relates to Animation Mode bug. This allows you to preview Remove Mesh components without selecting Mesh OR while in Animation Mode. Fixed # Texture Packing which resolves to the white texture would break the Unity Editor #1193 Performance issues with preview system #1195 Avatar Optimizer does not support Additive Reference Pose #1208 1.7.13-beta.1 - 2024-09-23 # Fixed # Null Reference Exception with newly created VRCAnimatorPlayAudio #1199 Particle System that uses local scale will be broken #1197 Avatars with Visame Skinned Mesh disabled will not able to upload #1202 1.8.0-beta.1 - 2024-09-20 # Added # AnyState to Entry/Exit optimization in Optimize Animator #1157 If AAO found animator layer only with AnyState, AAO tries to convert them to Entry / Exit pattern. Currently due to implementation there are some patterns that can be convert but but not converted. We may relax some restriction in the future. Because we have to check for each condition if we use AnyState but we can check for only one (in best case) with entry/exit, this generally reduces cost for checking an parameter in a state. Combined with Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree optimization, which is implemented in previous release, your AnyState layer may be optimized to 1D BlendTree. Optimize Texture in Trace nad Optimize #1181 #1184 Avatar Optimizer will pack texture and tries to reduce the VRAM usage. Currently liltoon is only supported. Copy Enablement Animation to Merge Skinned Mesh #1173 This feature copies activeness / enablement animation from merge target renderers to the merged renderer. This feature is not enabled by default. You have to enable it in the inspector. This feature supports copying activeness animation of activeSelf of the GameObjects or ancestors of the GameObjects. However, this feature does not work if multiple GameObjects (or both GameObject and Renderer itself) are animated. In addition, this feature will be animate the enabled of the merged renderer, so you must not animate the enabled of the merged renderer. If animations are unsupported, AAO will show an error message and abort the build. Support Read/Write disabled Meshes with Av3Emulator Enabled #1185 Previously, AAO cannot process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator. Since this release, AAO can process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator. In addition, AAO now supports non-Float32 vertex buffers. We still use Float32 internally so Int32 data might lose precision a little. However, AFAIK there is no real-world problem with this so we implemented this way. If you found such a case, please report it. This change make AAO incompatible with Unity without Graphics. If you\u0026rsquo;re building your avatar with batchmode with -nographics, please remove -nographics. Asset Description for Avatar Modify Support bundled in an avatar, Shinano #1189 Changed # Skip Enablement Mismatched Renderers is now disabled by default #1169 You still can enable it in the Inspector. This change does not affect the behavior of previously added components. Use UInt16 index buffer if possible even when total vertex count is more than 2^16 #1178 With baseVertex in index buffer, we can use UInt16 index buffer even if total vertex count is more than 2^16. Of course, if one submeh references wide range of vertices, we cannot use UInt16 index buffer so we still use UInt32 index buffer in such a case.

However, on Awake, we can read them so AAO should process them. Since this version, AAO will process meshes with R/W off on Awake. This reduces the number of errors on the apply on play. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Av3Emulator, you still see the error. In addition, in such case, we\u0026rsquo;ll show Auto Fix button on the error message. If you press the button, AAO will fix the error by changing the mesh to read/write enabled. Advanced Options section has benn renamed to Debug Options #1052 This express the purpose of the section more clearly. Added Advanced Optimizations and moved Remove Zero sized Polygons to it #1052 The Remove Zero sized Polygons can break some shaders or animations so it\u0026rsquo;s not enabled by default. To make it more clear, we moved it to Advanced Optimizations. Fixed # Material Slot animations for multi-material multi-pass rendering are broken #1042 Previously we only preserves animations for the number of submeshes instead of material slots. Relax Bounds condition for Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh #1043 Previously, AAO doesn\u0026rsquo;t merge Skinned Meshes if bounds are different accurately. Since this version, AAO will merge meshes if bounds are the same with precision to the last 6 digits of decimal point. Entry/Exit to BlendTree broken with None state 1048 Particle System with bone-rigged Skinned Mesh Renderer will be broken #1054 1.7.0 - 2024-04-30 # 1.7.0-rc.4 - 2024-04-26 # Changed # Disabled AutoFreezeBlendShape for Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component #1029 According to the report, making some polygons zero-size by AutoFreezeBlendShape will make initializing avatar extremely heavy. After a small discussion, we decided to not automatically optimize Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component. Fixed # Animating m_Enabled of Animator as a Behavior is broken #1028 Since Animator.property become animating float animation property named property, AAO must keep it as Behavior.m_Enabled instead of Animator.m_Enabled but we were not. 1.7.0-rc.3 - 2024-04-24 # 1.7.0-rc.2 - 2024-04-24 # Changed # It will be error if read/write mesh is off in play mode again #1018 I found that we may not possible to read mesh with r/w mesh off mode in play mode with the Av3Emulator. Fixed # Box Editor of Remove Mesh in Box can be broke with scale of Skinned Mesh Renderer #1019 Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh is broken with BlendTree #1020 Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh breaks mesh-shaped Particle System #1021 In addition, reference to Skinned Meshes might be broken and this is also fixed. 1.7.0-rc.1 - 2024-04-19 # 1.7.0-beta.7 - 2024-04-16 # Fixed # NRE with AutoMergeSkinnedMesh #1010 Error with some rare animation clip #1011 1.7.0-beta.6 - 2024-04-13 # Added # Animations animating missing GameObject is removed #994 Since this update, animations that targeting GameObjects with post-AAO paths is no longer working. Please create animations that targeting GameObjects with pre-AAO paths. Remove Mesh by Mask #998 With this component, you can remove polygons with mask texture. You can use use mask for MeshDeleterWithTexture or alpha mask to remove polygons. Remove Empty SubMesh in Trace and Optimize #1007 This removes empty SubMeshes including becomes empty by optimization. Fixed # dependency is not child of root error if humanoid bone is moved to out of animator game object #995 1.6.13 - 2024-04-13 # Fixed # Animator Controller on the VRCStation will be broken #1002 Remove Component can be fails with RequireComponent attribute #1003 1.6.12 - 2024-04-09 # Removed # Activeness Optimization for Constraint component #996 The constraint component is too complex to optimize correctly and reliably 1.7.0-beta.5 - 2024-04-07 # Added # Components API for Scripting Usage #976 Fixed # Fix skipped parameter values in Entry/Exit to BlendTree optimization #991 1.6.11 - 2024-04-07 # Fixed # Bounds become broken if Update When Offscreen is enabled #990 1.7.0-beta.4 - 2024-04-05 # Changed # Renamed MergeDirectBlendTree(Layers) to MergeBlendTreeLayer #984 1.6.10 - 2024-04-05 # Fixed # Missing Reference Exception with Trace and Optimize #986 1.7.0-beta.3 - 2024-04-04 # Added # Merge non Direct BlendTree in MergeDirectBlendTree #980 Support bool parameters in Entry/Exit to BlendTree optimization #982 Fixed # Skip Merge Direct BlendTree Option is flipped #978 1.7.0-beta.2 - 2024-04-01 # Changed # Relax preconditions of Entry/Exit to BlendTree optimization #970 Fixed # Some animation is Falsely detected as constant #968 Activeness of renderer GameObject is not correctly considered #972 Exclusions is not working for Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh #972 1.7.0-beta.1 - 2024-03-29 # Added # Animator Optimizer #854 Most features of Animator Optimizer is not available in Unity 2019. Animator Optimizer optimizes your Animator Controller without behaviour Changes Current Optimizer includes the following optimization Remove meaningless properties #854 Converts Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree #854 #867 #927 Merges multiple Direct BlendTree to single Direct BlendTree #870 Removes meaningless Animator Layers #870 Asset Description #847 Asset Description is the file to provide information of your assets for Avatar Optimizer. Please see documentation for more details. Warning for material animation in Merge Skinned Mesh #769 Merge Skinned Mesh does not support animating material properties differently. (In other words, it can be broken.) Since this version, AAO will warn for such a case. If you animated all materials from same animations, your animation will not be warned. API for declaring dependency relationship to the name of the component #943 You can use this API to not change the name of the GameObject. Configuring Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated) #957 Since VRCSDK 3.5.1, VRCSDK sets Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated) to true on assembly reload. This is not a good setting for AAO in EditMode since AAO does not support clamping BlendShapes. That\u0026rsquo;s why AAO now configures Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated) to false in edit mode and true in play mode. PlayMode is usually used for testing the avatar behavior so it\u0026rsquo;s better to have the same setting as VRChat client. If you want not to change this setting, please disable Tools/Avatar Optimizer/Configure Clamp BlendShape Weight. Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh #952 Trace and Optimize now automatically merges Skinned Meshes if possible. Trace and Optimize will merge your mesh if the material properties or enablement of the mesh is animated similarly and has no BlendShapes. Changed # MergePhysBone now corrects curve settings #775 MergePhysBone now warns if chain length are not same #775 MergePhysBone with only one source is now error #775 It was not working well and not a error by a bug. Animator Parser is completely rewritten #850 New Animator Parser allow us to track animating properties animated by components removed by AAO. PhysBone that swings no bones are now removed #864 I found such a PhysBone on Lime so I added this feature. Switched Localization system to NDMF from CL4EE #873 Since this release, Avatar Optimizer is no longer depends on CL4EE. Because VCC doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove unused packages, CL4EE may still be installed on your project. If you want to remove CL4EE, please remove it manually. Suppressed animated BlendShape warning of FreezeBlendShape if it\u0026rsquo;s animated to a few constants #881 Modern models have tons of BlendShapes to change their face shape but emotion animation of some of them animates such a BlendShapes to constant (default value). That\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary (incorrect I think) and force users to remove or change the clip when user wants to face shape. I see AAO users use FreezeBlendShapes for overriding such a BlendShapes on twitter. I think using this way is reasonable enough so I suppressed the warning if AAO detected such a usage. Minimum VRCSDK to 3.3.0 #882 VRCSDK 3.3.0 is required for stable NDMF-VRCSDK compatibility. Endpoint Position settings for newly created MergePhysBone is now Copy instead of Clear #945 The Clear settings will increase the number of PhysBone Transforms so it\u0026rsquo;s not better as a default settings. Improved activeness animation warning in Merge Skinned Mesh #948 Reduced false-positive warnings Previously, AAO warns if activeness warning is applied to different GameObjects. However, this can be false-positive if animation is applied to different GameObjects with same timing. Since this version, AAO will not warn if the activeness is animated in same animation clip with same curve. Combined warning per Merge Skinned Mesh component. Previously, AAO warns for each source Renderers. Since this version, AAO creates one warning for each Merge Skinned Mesh component. Add error for Cloth component in Merge Skinned Mesh component #949 The Cloth component is not supported by Merge Skinned Mesh component. In previous versions, AAO will keep the source Skinned Mesh Renderer if it\u0026rsquo;s with Cloth component by bug. Since this version, AAO will make an error if the source Skinned Mesh Renderer is with Cloth component. Remove Unused Objects now removes PhysBones and Contact Receivers with parameters defined but not used by Animator Controllers #959 Previously, AAO did not remove PhysBones and Contact Receivers if they are defined in Animator Controllers whether they are used or not. I thought such a PhysBones on the base body are rare but my friend told me there is Manuka has such a PhysBone so I added this feature. Dropping GameObject to PrefabSafeSet adds the All components on the GameObject to the PrefabSafeSet #960 You can add all PhysBones on the GameObject by dropping the GameObject to the MergePhysBone component. MergeSkinnedMesh now warns if Root Bone or Anchor Override are not set #963 Removed # Compatibility with VRCQuestTools v1.x #847 Please use VRCQuestTools v2.x, which has compatibility with AAO. Fixed # Inspector of ComponentTypePair (GCDebug) is broken #846 Bones swung by unused PhysBones (which will be removed by AAO) are not merged #850 Note that To fix this problem, AnimatorParser is almost completely rewritten. It\u0026rsquo;s not expected to have behavior change, but if you found some, please report it.

Remove unused Objects\nBy scanning animation etc., automatically removes unused Objects (e.g. GameObjects, Components).\nIn addition, this will automatically toggle PhysBone Components if they are only used by toggled objects. Preserve EndBone\nPrevents removing end bones1 whose parent is not removed. Optimize PhysBone Settings\nOptimizes PhysBone settings for better performance. This performs the following optimizations. Merges PhysBone Colliders with the exactly same settings into one PhysBone Collider. Unchecks Is Animated if it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary. Optimize Animator\nOptimizes Animator Controller. See this section for more details. Merge Skinned Meshes\nMerges skinned meshes which don\u0026rsquo;t need to be separated.\nSome meshes may not be automatically merged in some cases, so use Merge Skinned Mesh manually if necessary. Allow Shuffling Material Slots\nBy shuffling material slots, you may reduce draw calls of the avatar. The order of material slots usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but it may affect the drawing order in rare cases. Optimize Texture\nOptimizes textures without affecting the appearance.\nCurrently, UV Packing and reducing texture size is performed only for materials with supported shaders. Also, You can adjust optimization with the following settings\nMMD World Compatibility\nOptimize with considering compatibility with MMD Worlds. e.g. Not freezing BlendShapes used by MMD Worlds. In addition, there are the following Advanced Optimizations.\nAutomatically Remove Zero Sized Polygons\nRemoves polygons whose area are zero. This can break some shaders or animated scales, so use it carefully. Also, there is Debug Options which is for workaround bugs but it\u0026rsquo;s unstable \u0026amp; not well-tested. See tooltips or implementation for more details.\nAnimator Optimizer # This feature currently applies the following optimizations.\n(Details of optimization can be changed in the future.)\nConvert AnyState to Entry-Exit\nThis tries to convert Animator Controller layers of AnyState type to Diamond-style Entry-Exit type as possible.

Parameters Read By External Tools\nParameters that can be read by external tools, especially for OSC Tools. Parameters Changed By External Tools Parameters that can be changed by external tools, especially for OSC Tools. We will describe why Asset Description is needed for each information below.\nMeaningless Components # Avatar Optimizer has to know about all existing components in the Avatar to remove unnecessary ones.\nAvatar Optimizer v1.6.0 added document to make your components compatible with AAO and API for it, but for in-place modification tools that do not process on build, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit complicated to remove components by IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback instead of Avatar Optimizer. Therefore, Asset Description was added in v1.7.0 as a simple mechanism to specify components that should be ignored by Avatar Optimizer at build time.\nFor non-destructive tools, we still recommend you to continue to remove components in IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback or your NDMF Pass to prevent Avatar Optimizer from accidentally removing components when the execution order is incorrect.\nParameters Read By Extenral Tools # Components such as PhysBone and Contact Receiver will make parameters that can be read by OSC tools. Such parameters are readable by the OSC tools without being defined on Animator Controller or Expression Parameter.\nTherefore, Avatar Optimizer is unable to determine whether those parameters are simply unused or intended to be read by the OSC tools. Since undefined parameters are relatively rarely used by OSC Tools, components that make such parameters are removed if parameters are unused from anywhere on the avatar.\nTo prevent Avatar Optimizer from removing those parameters and components, you can specify the parameters that are read by OSC Tools in Asset Description.\nParameters Changed By External Tools # Currently this information is not actually used by Avatar Optimizer, but it is planned to be used in the future.\nAvatar Optimizer is planned to optimize Animator Controller by analyzing unchanged parameters. However, if the parameters are changed by external tools, this optimization will break effects of the external tools.\nTo prevent this, you can specify the parameters that are changed by external tools in Asset Description.\nCreate Asset Description # To create Asset Description, select Create/Avatar Optimizer/Asset Description from right-click menu in the Project window.\nAvatar Optimizer searches from all files, so the name and location of Asset Description are free.\nEditing Asset Description # Comment # The comment field is for writing notes.\nAvatar Optimizer ignores comments.\nMeaningless Components # Meaningless Components is the list of component types that you want Avatar Optimizer to ignore.\nPlease specify the Script Asset of the component.

Even if the weight is zero, removing BlendShapes will reduce the size of avatars. Removing unused Behaviours such as PhysBones If there are enabled PhysBones which do not need to be swayed (e.g., the swaying target mesh2 is always disabled), extra computational cost is caused. Merging bones which is not animated or swayed with PhysBones If the clothes bones are nested into the body bones, there will be many bones which are never moved locally. Such bones cause extra cost. Merging meshes which are toggled together or never toggled If your avatar has only one cloth, it might not be necessary to have separated meshes for body, hair, and clothes. Even if you have multiple switchable clothes, it might not be necessary to have separated meshes with body, hair, and underwear. With AvatarOptimizer, these optimizations can be performed automatically by simply adding AAO Trace And Optimize component to the Avatar Root!\nUpload Avatar # Now that you have added AAO Trace and Optimize component, let\u0026rsquo;s try uploading your avatar! AAO: Avatar Optimizer is a non-destructive avatar modification tool, and processes avatars on entering play mode or building them. Therefore, no special steps are required for uploading. Upload your avatar via VRCSDK Control Panal as usual.\nHowever, even though the hard limit will not be exceeded through Avatar Optimizer optimization, etc., the upload button cannot be pressed if the limit has been exceeded at the time of the VRCSDK pre-build check.\nYou can skip the pre-build check with several ways. Please refer faq for more details.\nChecking performance rank without uploading avatar # When using non-destructive avatar modification tools, Performance Rank on the VRCSDK Control Panel is no loner be relied upon.\nInstead, you can check Performance Rank in Play Mode with Actual Performance Window of anatawa12\u0026rsquo;s Gist Pack. Please check basic usages of anatawa12\u0026rsquo;s Gist Pack and documentation of Actual Performance Window for more details。\nApplying non-destructive tools manually # You can use NDM Framework/Manual bake avatar on the context menu of the Avatar GameObject to apply non-destructive tools manually.\nThis will clone your avatar and apply non-destructive tools to the cloned avatar, so your original avatar will not be modified.\nThis can be useful in some cases (e.g. when exporting a VRChat avatar in VRM format).\nReduce polygons with BlendShapes which shrink parts of the body # By removing polygons which are hidden by clothes or something, you can reduce rendering cost, BlendShape processing cost, etc. without affecting the appearance so much. To make this easier, AvatarOptimizer allows you to remove polygons with BlendShapes for shrinking parts of the body, which many avatars have!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s add AAO Remove Mesh By BlendShape component to Body Mesh, and select BlendShapes from the BlendShapes list below that shrink the parts of the body you want to remove!\nIn case polygons you want to remove are not removed, or you do not want to remove are removed, you need to adjust the Tolerance value! Tolerance decides how much the vertex is moved by BlendShape to be removed. If some parts intended to be removed are not removed, increase the value a little; otherwise, decrease it a little!\nBlendShape is the name of Morphing in Unity.

By using this API, you can create tools or components that add Avatar Optimizer components.\nComponents that supported by Component API # Currently, not all components are supported by Component API. Here is the list of components that are supported by Component API.\nRemoveMeshInBox - Adding component and configuring for that is supported RemoveMeshByBlendShape - Adding component and configuring for that is supported RemoveMeshByMask - Adding component and configuring for that is supported MergePhysBone - Adding component and configuring for that is supported TraceAndOptimize - Adding with default configuration is supported but configuring is not supported For components that supports configuring, to keep compatibility with future features that enabled by default, you need extra attention for the configuration. See document below for more details.\nGetting Started # To use Component API, you have to reference com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.runtime assembly in your assembly definition file. Since Avatar Optimizer does not work on the runtime, you should not depends on com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.runtime assembly for runtime build.\nWe may remove some classes from com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.runtime on runtime build in the future. In other words, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to avoid use of com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.runtime in runtime assembly, you should use it only in editor assembly.\nSecond, If you want to configure components, you have to call void Initialize(int version) method to ensure the compatibility with future features. The default setting of Avatar Optimizer can be changed in the future (as described in Behavior Stability).\nThe default setting of Components will be affected to the components added with GameObject.AddComponent\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;() method. Therefore, to keep behavior compability with future versions, you have to call Initialize method with the version of default configuration you want to use. The default configuration version should be described in the document of the Initialize method.\nWithout calling Initialize method, component will behave unexpectedly, or you may get error with future versions.\nConfiguring component is only supported just after adding component, and configuring already existing component on the GameObject is unsupported. This is because some future functionality might be incompatible with the existing component configuration.\nFor example, enabling the inversion option of AAO Remove Mesh By Box component, added in v1.8.0, changes the meaning of box, which makes it incompatible with tools intended only for v1.7 and earlier.\nSince Avatar Optimizer v1.9.0, Avatar Optimizer provides Component API for the MergePhysBone component, but it is special with semantic versioning.\nThis component is deeply integrated with the PhysBone component of VRChat SDK. If the implementation of the PhysBone component is changed, corresponding changes in MergePhysBone may be required to maintain functionality. In that case, we may add new properties or change existing properties of MergePhysBone without following semantic versioning.\nWhen we add that new backward-compatible properties to MergePhysBone for following new PhysBone properties.\nThis is typically done in bumps1 version of VRChat SDK.\nWe treat adding support for new PhysBone properties as \u0026ldquo;bugfix for unsupported PhysBone features\u0026rdquo;, so this is done in patch version of Avatar Optimizer.\nWhen we change signature of existing properties (in other words, introduce breaking changes) of MergePhysBone for following breaking changes of existing PhysBone properties.\nAvatar Optimizer declares compatibility with specific range of breaking versions of VRChat SDK, so this change can only be done when Avatar Optimizer introduces support for new breaking1 version of VRChat SDK.\nWe work to minimize such breaking changes, but please be aware of this possibility when using Component API for MergePhysBone.\nIn some cases, even when using the same version of Avatar Optimizer, property types and others may be different depending on used VRChat SDK version.\nTo protect your code from breaking changes like above, we recommend to check the VRChat SDK version with vpmDependencies.\nBreaking changes like above only happen when Avatar Optimizer introduces support for new breaking version of VRChat SDK.\nTherefore, if you lock the VRChat SDK version with vpmDependencies, your code will be safe from such breaking changes, as long as no conflict in package version happens.\nVRChat SDK uses \u0026lsquo;Branding.Breaking.Bumps\u0026rsquo; versioning scheme where Breaking will be incremented for breaking changes, and Bumps will be incremented for backward compatible changes.

How to improve the compatibility? If you have some question, please feel free to ask on Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon) or NDMF Discord.\nWhen can components be incompatible with Avatar Optimizer? # If your components are on the avatar and still exist when Avatar Optimizer processes it, your components can be incompatible with Avatar Optimizer.\nAvatar Optimizer is designed to process at the last of the build process, components unknown to Avatar Optimizer is not supported.\nFor example, Avatar Optimizer has Garbage Collection system for Components and others. To correctly remove unused components, and correctly keep used components, Avatar Optimizer has to know about all existing components in the Avatar at the optimization.\nTo avoid problem with unknown components, Avatar Optimizer currently assumes unknown components\nhave to be kept if the component can be enabled and active at runtime. This is because Avatar Optimizer assumes unknown components are runtime components. will have dependency relationship to all components referenced in the component. (Those assumptions above can be changed in the future.)\nHowever, those assumptions can be incorrect, so Avatar Optimizer will generate a warning like below.\nHow to improve the compatibility? # To improve the compatibility, you may implement one of the following methods.\nRemove your components before Avatar Optimizer processes as much as possible.\nIf your component is not working at runtime, (in other words, it\u0026rsquo;s a build-time or edit mode only component), it\u0026rsquo;s mostly better for your tool to process avatar before Avatar Optimizer processes, and remove your components before Avatar Optimizer processes.\nPlease refer section below for more details.\nAvatar Optimizer internally uses this method for most Avatar Optimizer components, that will be processed before Trace and Optimize.\nRegister your components to Avatar Optimizer with API\nIf your component is working at runtime, or your tool actually wants to keep your components for processing avatar after Avatar Optimizer processes, you can register your components to Avatar Optimizer to tell about your components.\nPlease refer section below for more details.\nAvatar Optimizer internally uses this method to keep some components that are processed after Trace and Optimize, and components from Unity, VRCSDK, and other avatar platform components.\nRegister your components as no problems to remove with Asset Description.\nSince Avatar Optimizer v1.7.0, you can use Asset Description to register components only for holding data for edit-mode tools, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t affects on build or at runtime. If your tool process nothing at build time or runtime, you can use this to register your components instead of removing your components before Avatar Optimizer processes.\nPlease refer Asset Description for more details.\nIf your tool process something at build time or runtime, registering with Asset Description is not recommended. If you use Asset Description for components that process something at build time or runtime, it may cause unexpectedly removing your components and your tool not working properly when the execution order is incorrect or unexpectedly changed.\nAvatar Optimizer internally uses this method to keep compatibility with well-known edit-mode tools.\nRemoving your components # There are several ways to process and remove your components from avatar before Avatar Optimizer processes on build. You can use DestroyImmediate method for removing your components.\nIf your tool is a non-destructive tool based on NDMF1, you can remove your components before the phases prior to the Optimizing phase of NDMF or before com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer plugin (with BeforePlugin) in the Optimizing phase. If your tool removes your components in Optimizing phase, it\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended to specify BeforePlugin even if your default callback order is before com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer plugin.\nIf your tool is a non-destructive tool not based on NDMF1, removing your components before the NDMF\u0026rsquo;s Optimizing phase is recommended. In this case, current NDMF executes Optimizing phase in order -1025, which is JUST before VRCSDK\u0026rsquo;s RemoveAvatarEditorOnly callback, so your tool should remove components with IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback with callbackOrder smaller than -1025.\nIf your components is only for holding data for your edit-mode tool and doesn\u0026rsquo;t affects on build or at runtime, you can remove your components in IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback as described above, or you can simply use Asset Description to register your components as safe-to-remove components.\nRegistering your components # If you want to keep your component after Avatar Optimizer processes, you can register your components to Avatar Optimizer to tell about your components.\nFirst, to call APIs of Avatar Optimizer, please make an assembly definition file2 if your tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t have.\nNext, add com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.api.editor to assembly references in asmdef file.\nIf your tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to depend on Avatar Optimizer, please use Version Defines.

Override GetMaterialInformation to register texture and UV usage for materials using your shader. ShaderInformationRegistry: Static class used to register your ShaderInformation implementation with Avatar Optimizer during editor initialization. MaterialInformationCallback: Passed to GetMaterialInformation, provides methods to read material properties and register texture/UV usage information. Null Values # Throughout the Shader Information API, null values have a consistent meaning: they represent either unknown values or animated (statically undecidable) values. When a material property might be animated or its value cannot be determined at build time, the API returns null to indicate uncertainty. You should pass null for parameters when their values cannot be determined statically.\nGetting Started # To provide Shader Information for your shader, follow these steps:\n1. Create an Assembly Definition # If your shader package doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an Editor assembly definition, create one. The assembly should be Editor-only since Shader Information is only used at build time and Shader Information API is only available for Editor build.\n2. Add Assembly Reference # Add com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer.api.editor to your assembly definition\u0026rsquo;s references.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to require Avatar Optimizer as the dependency, use Version Defines with symbols like AVATAR_OPTIMIZER, to detect if Avatar Optimizer is installed and if AAO version is newer than specified version.\nWe recommended version range like [1.8,2.0) (supports v1.8.0 and later but will require updates for v2.0.0).

For textures that don\u0026rsquo;t use mesh UVs (screen space, MatCap, view-direction based, etc.), use UsingUVChannels.NonMesh:\nmatInfo.RegisterTextureUVUsage( \u0026#34;_MatCapTexture\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_MatCapTexture\u0026#34;, UsingUVChannels.NonMesh, // Not from mesh UVs null // No UV transform ); If the UV channel depends on a material property,\nvar uvChannel = matInfo.GetFloat(\u0026#34;_UVChannel\u0026#34;) switch { 0 =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV0, 1 =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV1, _ =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV0 | UsingUVChannels.UV1 // Unknown, could be either }; matInfo.RegisterTextureUVUsage(\u0026#34;_DetailTex\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;_DetailTex\u0026#34;, uvChannel, uvMatrix); UV Transform Matrices # UV transform matrices describe how UVs are transformed before sampling the texture. Tipical Unity shaders use Scale Offset value from material properties (like _MainTex_ST). You can convert Scale Offset to a Matrix2x3 using Matrix2x3.NewScaleOffset.\nvar texST = matInfo.GetVector(\u0026#34;_MainTex_ST\u0026#34;); Matrix2x3? uvMatrix = texST is { } st ? Matrix2x3.NewScaleOffset(st) : null; You can also build matrices manually if needed. If the UV transform is animated or calculated dynamically, use null.\nRegistering Vertex Index Usage # When your shader registers vertex index usage, Avatar Optimizer will try to preserve vertex indices from the original mesh. This currently disables automatic Merge Skinned Mesh feature in Trace and Optimize, but more features may be affected later.\nSince this method is to preserve vertex indices, when your shader uses vertex indices just for generating random sequences, it\u0026rsquo;s not a good idea to register RegisterVertexIndexUsage.\npublic override void GetMaterialInformation(MaterialInformationCallback matInfo) { // ... register textures ... // Check if the feature using vertex indices is enabled if (matInfo.GetFloat(\u0026#34;_UseVertexIdEffect\u0026#34;) != 0) { // Tell this shader wants Avatar Optimizer to preserve vertex indices matInfo.RegisterVertexIndexUsage(); } } Registering Shader Information # You have to register your ShaderInformation implementation to link information to your shader. There are two ways to register Shader Information:\nRegister by GUID (Recommended) # For shader assets, use the shader\u0026rsquo;s GUID. This method is recommended because GUIDs don\u0026rsquo;t change, won\u0026rsquo;t duplicate, and don\u0026rsquo;t require accessing AssetDatabase (accessing AssetDatabase in InitializeOnLoad methods is not valid, so registering by shader instance can become invalid).\nShaderInformationRegistry.RegisterShaderInformationWithGUID( \u0026#34;your-shader-asset-guid\u0026#34;, new YourShaderInformation() ); Register by Shader Instance # For shaders dynamically created on build or when you have the shader instance, you can register with shader instance.\nShader shader = Shader.Find(\u0026#34;Your/Shader/Name\u0026#34;); ShaderInformationRegistry.RegisterShaderInformation( shader, new YourShaderInformation() ); Best Practices # Use InitializeOnLoad # Register your Shader Information in a static constructor with [InitializeOnLoad] to register before \u0026lsquo;apply on play\u0026rsquo; builds.\n[InitializeOnLoad] internal class YourShaderInformation : ShaderInformation { static YourShaderInformation() { // Registration happens automatically when Unity loads Register(); } private static void Register() { ShaderInformationRegistry.RegisterShaderInformationWithGUID( \u0026#34;guid\u0026#34;, new YourShaderInformation() ); } } Handle Unknown Values # Material properties might be animated or unknown. Handle null values. Even when your shader does not support animating a property, Avatar Optimizer may pass it as null since Avatar Optimizer may process multiple materials at once.\n// Use pattern matching var st = matInfo.GetVector(\u0026#34;_MainTex_ST\u0026#34;); Matrix2x3? uvMatrix = st is { } st2 ? Matrix2x3.NewScaleOffset(st2) : null; // Use union value for null cases var uvChannel = matInfo.GetFloat(\u0026#34;_UVChannel\u0026#34;) switch { 0 =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV0, 1 =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV1, null =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV0 | UsingUVChannels.UV1, // Unknown _ =\u0026gt; UsingUVChannels.UV0 | UsingUVChannels.UV1 }; Check Keywords and Properties # Only register textures that are actually used:\nif (matInfo.IsShaderKeywordEnabled(\u0026#34;_NORMALMAP\u0026#34;) != false) { // Keyword might be enabled, register normal map } if (matInfo.GetFloat(\u0026#34;_UseEmission\u0026#34;) != 0) { // Emission is enabled, register emission map } Note: != false checks if the value is true or null (unknown). This conservative approach assumes features are enabled if unknown.\nProvide Accurate Information # Only set VertexIndexUsage if vertex indices truly matter Use correct sampler states (affects texture filtering during atlasing) Set UV matrices to null if they\u0026rsquo;re dynamic or animated Use UsingUVChannels.NonMesh for screen-space UVs Use internal class for Shader Information Classes # To avoid exposing your Shader Information classes in your assembly\u0026rsquo;s public API, we recommend declaring them as internal class. This helps keep your codebase clean and prevents accidental misuse of internal details.\nIf your editor doesn\u0026rsquo;t have public API, you may set your assembly definition Auto Reference to false to avoid exposing classes to Assembly-CSharp.\nComplete Examples # Here\u0026rsquo;s some simple ShaderInformation examples for simple shaders.\nFor more complex examples, see Avatar Optimizer\u0026rsquo;s built-in shader information implementations on GitHub.\nSimple Shader with Main Texture # [InitializeOnLoad] internal class SimpleShaderInformation : ShaderInformation { static SimpleShaderInformation() { ShaderInformationRegistry.RegisterShaderInformationWithGUID( \u0026#34;your-shader-guid\u0026#34;, new SimpleShaderInformation() ); } public override ShaderInformationKind SupportedInformationKind =\u0026gt; ShaderInformationKind.TextureAndUVUsage; public override void GetMaterialInformation(MaterialInformationCallback matInfo) { var mainTexST = matInfo.GetVector(\u0026#34;_MainTex_ST\u0026#34;); Matrix2x3? uvMatrix = mainTexST is { } st ?
