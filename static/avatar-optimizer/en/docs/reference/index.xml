This component will trace your avatar and optimize your avatar automatically. You can enable/disable some automatic optimization features with checkboxes.
This component should be added to an avatar root. (Kind: Avatar Global Component)
Currently the following optimizations are applied automatically.
Automatically Freeze Blend Shape
Automatically freezes unused BlendShapes in animation or else. Remove unused Objects
By scanning animation etc., automatically removes unused Objects (e.</description></item><item><title>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/unused-bones-by-references-tool/</guid><description>UnusedBonesByReferencesTool # Marks it as EditorOnly that bones referenced only from EditorOnly meshes.
This component should be added to an avatar root. (Kind: Avatar Global Component)
This component is obsolete. You should use Remove unused Objects of Trace and Optimize instead. This component will never get algorithm improvements. This is port of UnusedBonesByReferencesTool by Narazaka but run at build time.</description></item><item><title>Merge Skinned Mesh</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-skinned-mesh/</guid><description>Merge Skinned Mesh # Merges one or more SkinnedMeshRenderer and MeshRenderers into one SkinnedMeshRenderer.
This component should be added to a new GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component without Mesh specified. (Kind: Source Edit Skinned Mesh Component)
Benefits # Merging SkinnedMeshRenderer will reduce number of deforming mesh (skinning). Also, it can reduce material slots using the same material, so we can reduce rendering cost.
Notes # This component makes it impossible to turn meshes on and off individually on animations, but material-related animations will work without modification.</description></item><item><title>Freeze BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/freeze-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/freeze-blendshape/</guid><description>Freeze BlendShape # Freeze &amp;amp; remove BlendShape from the mesh.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component. (Kind: Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component)
Benefits # Freezing &amp;amp; removing BlendShapes has the following benefits.
For BlendShapes with non-zero weight, freezing BlendShapes will reduce processing cost. Even if the weight is zero, removing BlendShapes will reduce the size of avatars. Notes # By freezing BlendShape, the weights cannot be changed on Animation.</description></item><item><title>Merge ToonLit Material</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-toonlit-material/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-toonlit-material/</guid><description>Merge ToonLit Material # Merge VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit materials to one material by packing texture manually.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component. (Kind: Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component)
This component currently only supports VRChat/Mobile/Toon Lit because I believe there are big demands but I may add support for other shaders. (also for third-party shaders) If you want other shader support, please write a issue</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh By BlendShape</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/</guid><description>Remove Mesh By BlendShape # Remove vertices transformed by specified BlendShape and their polygons.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component. (Kind: Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component)
Benefits # By removing polygons which are hidden by clothes or something, you can reduce rendering cost, BlendShape processing cost, etc. without affecting the appearance so much. You can use this component to easily remove polygons with BlendShapes for shrinking parts of the body, which many avatars have.</description></item><item><title>Remove Mesh in Box</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-in-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-in-box/</guid><description>Remove Mesh in Box # Remove some polygons in any of specified boxes.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component. (Kind: Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component)
Benefits # By removing polygons which are hidden by clothes or something, you can reduce rendering cost, BlendShape processing cost, etc. without affecting the appearance so much.
Settings # Adjust the value to add box. For each box, you can change the center Position, Size, and Rotation of the box.</description></item><item><title>Clear Endpoint Position</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/clear-endpoint-position/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/clear-endpoint-position/</guid><description>Clear Endpoint Position # This component will replace EndpointPosition to 0 with adding _EndPhysBone GameObject.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has PhysBone Components.
This component doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any configuration for now but there&amp;rsquo;s one button on the view. Clicking Apply and Remove component will applies this operation and removes this component. This may be useful for developing avatars.</description></item><item><title>Merge Bone</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-bone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-bone/</guid><description>Merge Bone # If you add this component to some GameObject, the GameObject will be removed and merged to parent GameObject. Also, if some other components are attached to the target GameObject, they will be removed too.
If the parent GameObject also have Merge Bone component, two GameObjects are merged to their further parent GameObject.
All children of GameObject where this component is applied will belong to parent of this GameObject.</description></item><item><title>Merge PhysBone</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-physbone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/merge-physbone/</guid><description>Merge PhysBone # This component merges multiple PhysBone Components into one Component with MultiChildType == Ignore.
This component should be added to a new GameObject.
Settings # Components # The list of PhysBone Component.
Drop to None element at the bottom to add PhysBone and reset to None to remove from the list.
Overrides # Below the configurations, there&amp;rsquo;s configurations like VRCPhysBone. For each property, you may select Copy to copy value from source property (only available if values from the sources are same) or Override to set new value instead.</description></item><item><title>Remove Zero Sized Polygon</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-zero-sized-polygon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-zero-sized-polygon/</guid><description>Remove Zero Sized Polygon # Remove polygons whose area are zero.
This component should be added to a GameObject which has a SkinnedMeshRenderer component.
Since this component works very late in the build process, this component is NOT Modifying Edit Skinned Mesh Component.
Adding this component to the SkinnedMeshRenderers to be merged by Merge Skinned Mesh component has no effect.
Benefits # By removing polygons whose area are zero, you can reduce rendering cost.</description></item><item><title>Make Children</title><link>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/make-children/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/make-children/</guid><description>Make Children # These specified objects will be the children of this GameObject at build time.
This component is deprecated.
This function is not related to avatar optimization, so this component will be replaced by one in a currently planned non-destructive Avatar Modification Utils.</description></item></channel></rss>
